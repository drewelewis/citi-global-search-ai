Got money you want to sock away for your children's education? Here are three tax-advantaged accounts to consider.", "tag-3": "529 college savings plans. These state-sponsored plans allow tax-free withdrawals as long as the money is used for qualified college expenses. If you contribute to a plan from your own state, you may also get a break on your state taxes. Parents could each contribute up to $13,000 in 2012 to a child's account without worrying about the federal gift tax. Each parent could even make a onetime gift of $65,000 and treat it as his or her gift for the next five years, with no further contributions allowed under the gift-tax exclusion. (The estate would recapture a pro-rata portion of the contribution if the parent were to die during this five-year period). As owners of the account, parents control how the money is used. In addition, because the money is considered a parental asset, it isn't as damaging to a family's financial-aid eligibility as savings that are in a child's name.", "tag-4": "Coverdell education savings accounts. If you want more investment choices than you get with a 529 plan, consider a Coverdell. Currently, you can make tax-free Coverdell withdrawals to pay for private elementary and secondary school, as well as college. If parents set up a Coverdell, they keep control of the money and the impact on aid eligibility is relatively modest. But unlike a 529, there are income restrictions on who can fund these accounts and the contribution limits are much lower. In 2012, no more than $2,000 can be saved in a Coverdell for any particular beneficiary. Moreover, unless Congress acts, the contribution limit will fall to $500 in 2013 and pre-college education costs will no longer be considered qualified expenses.", "tag-5": "Custodial accounts. Parents can set up custodial accounts for their children under the Uniform Gift to Minors Act or Uniform Transfer to Minors Act and enjoy some tax advantages. For children under age 19, or dependent fulltime students under age 24, the first $950 of unearned income is tax-free in 2012 and the next $950 is taxed at the child's federal rate. Any earnings above $1,900 are taxed at the parents' federal rate. Problem is, once children reach the age of majority, which might be 18 or 21 depending on the state, they can get control of the account and can use the money as they wish. In addition, because custodial accounts are considered the child's asset, they can have a large impact on financial-aid eligibility.", "tag-6": "For more from Jonathan Clements, click here.", "tag-7": "INVESTMENT PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022 NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-8": "Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates do not provide tax or legal advice.
