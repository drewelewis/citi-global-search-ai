Got a 401(k)? If you're under age 50, you can contribute a maximum $17,000 in 2012, up from this year's $16,500 limit.", "tag-1": "Next Year by the Numbers", "tag-2": "Along with the arrival of 2012 come some key changes in the IRS limits that affect our financial lives. Got a 401(k)? If you're under age 50, you can contribute a maximum $17,000 in 2012, up from this year's $16,500 limit.", "tag-3": "Thanks to that increase, as well as the opportunity to make catch-up contributions, folks age 50 and up will be able to invest $22,500 in their 401(k) next year, compared with 2011's $22,000. To take advantage of these higher limits, you may want to bump up the amount you contribute to your 401(k).", "tag-4": "Meanwhile, the maximum contribution for Roth and traditional Individual Retirement Accounts remains at $5,000, or $6,000 for those age 50 and up. These contribution limits apply to all IRAs combined, so if you're under 50 and you put $3,000 in a Roth, you would only be eligible to stash $2,000 in a traditional IRA.", "tag-5": "The federal estate-tax exemption rises to $5,120,000 in 2012, from $5 million this year. If Congress doesn't act, the federal exemption will revert to $1 million in 2013, which means many more folks could potentially face federal estate taxes. Meanwhile, the gift-tax exclusion stays at $13,000 next year. This is the sum you can give to another person each year without worrying about the gift tax.", "tag-6": "As usual, we will see modest increases next year in items like the standard deduction, personal exemptions and the income levels you have to reach before you move into a higher tax bracket.
