A community leader, she was able to encourage her neighbors to join the program.", "tag-10": "Charlie Ayco, Chief Executive of Habitat for Humanity Philippines, said, \"The poorest families with the least to begin with are those most devastated by disasters. Packaging financial education, technical assistance and a savings product together will help families reduce their vulnerability to disasters. With this support from Citi and First Macro Bank, lasting changes will be made to lives in Pateros and elsewhere.\"", "tag-11": "\"I signed up because I learned so much about budgeting and saving during the training,\" said Ms. Payapag. \"I never thought of saving even five pesos for my dream of having a decent shelter. I've been busy providing for my children's education. But when I heard the explanations of the trainers from Habitat for Humanity, my mind was opened to the possibility of achieving my goal of having a better home.\"", "tag-12": "When speaking with Mr. Apte, Ms. Payapag shared her plans to replace her roof which now leaks in different parts whenever it rains.
