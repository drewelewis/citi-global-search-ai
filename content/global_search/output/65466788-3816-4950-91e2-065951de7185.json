Those age 50 and above can do just that, thanks to the catch-up contributions they can make to Individual Retirement Accounts and to 401(k) and similar employer-sponsored retirement plans. <br><br>Those 50 and older can put as much as $23,000 into a 401(k) in 2013, versus a $17,500 maximum for folks who are younger. The 50-plus crowd can also invest as much as $6,500 in an IRA, compared to $5,500 for those under age 50. <br><br>Let's say you maxed out your 401(k) every year for 15 years, starting at age 50. Assuming you earned 5% a year and you were able to contribute the full $23,000 a year, you would have more than $521,000 at age 65. Any matching employer contributions would be gravy, on top of what you save. <br><br>Fully funding an IRA could also add significantly to your nest egg. Once again, assume that you earned 5% a year.
