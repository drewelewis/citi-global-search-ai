They also spent time in \"I Love My Planet Earth\" room, which features exhibits on climate change and other environmental issues, plus tips on how everyone can do their share in saving the planet.", "tag-6": "These proved to be the ideal backdrop for the next set of activities, including a talk from the Philippine National Red Cross on disaster preparedness. Red Cross Volunteer JC Garcia engaged the students and teachers on how to respond during emergency situations. The students were taught what to do before, during and after typhoons and earthquakes. To keep the lecture more interesting, the instructor conducted games related to nature topics.", "tag-7": "After the talk, Museo Pambata presented a shadow story-telling, entitled Bahay Buhay (Home Life).

Some had to evacuate their homes for safety and were still unable to return weeks later.", "tag-13": "\"Citi, both our employees and as an institution, are deeply committed to environmental sustainability. We trust the activities opened the minds of the students on how they can protect themselves during disaster situations, and also come to their families' aid when needed.
