How determined were you to ski? </strong> <br><br>A: My father used to go off to ski with my brother and leave me at home. It made me so angry, and finally one day I asked him, \"What do I have to do to be able to go?\" He replied, \"Well, you have to learn how to ski first,\" and that was it. I put my brother's skis, boots and poles on, made myself a track in the sage brush and taught myself how to ski. <br><br><strong>Q: How did that determination play out later when your coaches suspended you for lack of determination and you trained in Hawaii to come back? </strong> <br><br>A: Most people go to Hawaii to kick back on the beach and maybe have a barbecue. I went to Hawaii for boot camp. I did sit-ups and pushups for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I moved piles of rock just because my dad told me to. I swam out in the ocean, which scared the bejesus out of me, but I was out there swimming in it anyway. And when I got back to the ski team, I was bound and determined to prove to them that I had that attitude adjustment and was in good physical condition. I did my pushups knuckle style on the track until they told me to stop, because I could've done it forever. <br><br><strong>Q: Was it an emotional experience for you when you medaled? </strong> <br><br>A: When I won my gold medal, it was overwhelming and amazing. I was actually so satisfied it scared me. I thought I was going to be the tough guy standing proudly on the podium, but as soon as the national anthem started playing in my honor, and in our country's honor, I bawled like a baby. <br><br><strong>Q: What advice would you give to young athletes? </strong> <br><br>A: I would tell them to believe in yourself. You're worth it. Put in the time and be honest about how hard you're working, and then have a plan for your success. Think about what are you going to do once you achieve it, and how you're going to pay it forward and make sure that you stay humble. <br><br><strong>Q: How rewarding for you is it to help others now after going through so many obstacles? </strong> <br><br>A: I went through so much throughout my career. I had several injuries, but most of the soft tissue injuries just made me angry and pushed me harder. The structural injury, which broke my femur, scared me a lot, but I learned so much about myself, what I'm capable of and that my strengths are really internal. I now get so much pleasure out of helping the next generation to do prehab to keep them on the slopes, to also check their equipment and ensure they're doing necessary cross-training. And when they do get injured, it's really satisfying to be able to talk to them, motivate them and help them through it. You learn more when you fail than when you succeed. <br><br><a href=\"https://everystep.citi.com/#picabo\">Learn more</a> about how you can support Picabo and the Team USA Stay on the Slopes Initiative.", "tag-1": "Q&A with Team Citi Member Picabo Street: Overcoming Injuries and Intense Determination", "tag-2": "Join us as we profile nine Team Citi athletes on the Citi Blog through our Every Step of the Way program .
