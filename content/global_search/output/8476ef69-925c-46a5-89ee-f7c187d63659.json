What to do? Consider bundling together different sources of retirement income so you have at least enough cash coming in to cover core living expenses, such as utilities, groceries, taxes, insurance and any rent or mortgage. That way, you can be fairly confident you can cover the bills, even if the financial markets go through a rocky spell.", "tag-1": "Putting a Floor Under Your Retirement Income", "tag-2": "After decades in the workforce, it can be unnerving to retire and give up that regular paycheck. What to do?

That way, you can be fairly confident you can cover the bills, even if the financial markets go through a rocky spell.", "tag-3": "This regular income stream might consist of Social Security retirement benefits, any pension income, dividends from stocks, annuity income, and interest from bonds and certificates of deposit. You might think of this as your income floor, the minimum income you can reasonably expect each year. In better years for the financial markets, you might supplement this income floor by, say, cashing in some of your stocks and stock funds. Keep in mind that selling may trigger a tax bill.", "tag-4": "What if you find it tough to generate enough retirement income to cover your core living expenses? You might consider postponing Social Security, so you get a larger monthly check. That will likely mean dipping more heavily into savings to cover expenses during your initial retirement years, while you're waiting to claim Social Security.", "tag-5": "You also might consider purchasing an immediate-fixed annuity that pays lifetime income. That will involve handing over a chunk of your savings to an insurance company in return for a check every month for the rest of your life. The annuity income will depend on the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company.", "tag-6": "To be sure, there is a risk that you might die at a relatively young age and thus receive precious few monthly checks in return for your big annuity investment. Still, if it looks like you might be short on retirement income, an immediate-fixed annuity may provide significantly more income than, say, buying bonds or CDs.", "tag-7": "For more from Jonathan Clements, click here.", "tag-8": "INVESTMENT AND INSURANCE PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022 NOT A BANK DEPOSIT \u2022 NOT INSURED BY ANY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY \u2022 NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-9": "The investment strategies presented are not appropriate or suitable for every investor, and there is no guarantee that these strategies will succeed.

In general, as prevailing interest rates rise, fixed income securities prices will fall. Bonds face credit risk if a decline in an issuer's credit rating, or creditworthiness, causes a bond's price to decline. High yield bonds are subject to additional risks such as increased risk of default and greater volatility because of the lower credit quality of the issues. Finally, bonds can be subject to prepayment risk. When interest rates fall, an issuer may choose to borrow money at a lower interest rate, while paying off its previously issued bonds. As a consequence, underlying bonds will lose the interest payments from the investment and will be forced to reinvest in a market where prevailing interest rates are lower than when the initial investment was made.", "tag-11": "CDs maturing on or before December 31, 2013, are insured by the FDIC up to $250,000.", "tag-12": "All guarantees are based on the claims paying ability of the issuing insurance company.
