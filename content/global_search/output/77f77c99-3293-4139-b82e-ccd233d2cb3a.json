Wagner Graduate School of Public Service (NYU Wagner) today jointly released a new Citi-funded report that details 15 policies from other cities that have clear potential for replication and implementation in New York.", "tag-4": "\"Innovation and the City,\" produced with the support of Citi Community Development, concludes that New York City's next mayor will need to innovate and experiment to address some of the city's biggest challenges \u2013 and that the search for applicable solutions should start in other cities, noting recent pioneering government reforms in metropolises from Seattle to London.", "tag-5": "The report is the culmination of a six-month project in which researchers from the Center for an Urban Future and NYU Wagner interviewed nearly 200 policy experts in cities across the U.S. and around the world to identify the most innovative and effective urban policies, and then assess which of those reforms could actually work in New York. The experts narrowed down a wide range of suggestions to ultimately present 15 of the most promising policies, which address technology, education, waste management, housing, and good government reforms, among other policy areas.", "tag-6": "\"Just as New York under Mayor Bloomberg has been a model of policy innovation for so many other cities, the city's next mayor should look to other cities for inspiration on how to tackle the big challenges still facing New York,\" said Jonathan Bowles, executive director of the Center for an Urban Future. \"Cities have become the real drivers of policy innovation, and there are a lot of good models for what New York should do.\"", "tag-7": "\"With fewer resources and more pressure to produce, cities are generating incredible innovations across the country,\" said Neil Kleiman, director of the Wagner Innovation Labs at New York University. \"This project provides a snapshot of what we can learn.

In collaboration with Citi, Kindergarten to College is helping San Francisco families to start saving for college earlier and to save more, by removing barriers to opening an account and providing incentives to spur contributions.", "tag-11": "Denver: Sending Public Agency Staff to Innovation School One of the challenges with government innovations is that many good ideas flounder inside the agencies where they were born. Direct-line workers either wait out reform ideas they dislike or simply lack the tools and training orientation to move a promising new initiative to actuation. Based on the belief that true innovation must be embraced by line-level staff as much as by mayors and agency heads, Denver launched Peak Academy, an innovation school where city employees can get training, develop new ideas and gain support for new approaches.", "tag-12": "London: Crowdsourcing Capital Projects The world's first \"funding platform for public space projects,\" London's Spacehive is like Kickstarter, but for civic projects.

The aim is to encourage the development of talents and skills that too often go unrecognized in the K-12 school system. A digital badge is a visible online record of achievement, the work required, and information about the organization or individual that issued the badge. Once earned, badges could follow students throughout their lifetimes, being displayed on websites or included in college applications and r\u00e9sum\u00e9s.", "tag-14": "Boston and Chicago: Reinventing 311 New York was one of the early pioneers of the 311 constituent service platform, but in the era of the smartphone, it's time to create a more responsive, transparent, and participatory 311 system. Cities like Boston and Chicago are implementing innovative ideas are leveraging open source data and the capabilities of mobile computing to better serve residents and increase accountability among government agencies.", "tag-15": "San Francisco: Tax-Free Transit Benefits San Francisco now requires employers in the city with more than 20 employees to offer tax-free transit benefits to their employees. While many New Yorkers already take advantage of this federal tax benefit, only about a quarter of large and medium companies in the city offer them. Increasing the number of New Yorkers who benefit from this program would save transit riders hundreds of dollars a year on commuting costs, help businesses save money on payroll taxes and ensure that more of the income earned in New York stays in the local economy.", "tag-16": "To access the full report, visit http://nycfuture.org.", "tag-17": "Center for an Urban Future The Center for an Urban Future is an independent NYC-based policy institute dedicated to highlighting the critical opportunities and challenges facing New York and other cities, and providing fresh ideas and workable solutions to policymakers.
