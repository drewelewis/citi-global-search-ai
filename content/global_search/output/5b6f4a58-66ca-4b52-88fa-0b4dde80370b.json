This service is particularly convenient for those who use public transport from time to time: they will always have on hand their credit card, which also functions as a universal public transport ticket. We plan to expand our offering in this area and add new services to the CitiExpress package in the future. We also hope that in offering such a service we will be making our own small contribution to reducing the traffic load on Moscow's roads.\"", "tag-6": "The cost of each trip is calculated according to the tariffs established by the transport operator. The number of trips is not limited. The total amount for trips taken is charged at the beginning of the following calendar month.
