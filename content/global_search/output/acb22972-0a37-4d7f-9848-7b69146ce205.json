Bloomberg's New Housing Marketplace Plan (NHMP), an $8.5 billion initiative to finance 165,000 units of affordable housing for half a million New Yorkers by the close of the 2014 fiscal year. To date, the plan has funded the creation or preservation of more than 124,400 units of affordable housing across the five boroughs; 10,300 of those units are in Manhattan Community District 10, where the Randolph Houses are located.", "tag-5": "\"This is the first development of its kind in New York City,\" said HPD Commissioner Mathew M. Wambua. \"True Colors Residence is the epitome of what we mean when we say 'fair housing.' It is a testament to the City's commitment to providing affordable housing for New Yorkers with special, specific needs. This development not only puts a roof over their heads, but also provides a system of support that will help these vulnerable young men and women and others who may need assistance, take steps toward creating a foundation upon which they can build the rest of their lives. Starting with the City's Acquisition Fund, I thank our partners at Citi, M&T and the Federal Home Loan Bank, West End, Borough President Stringer's office, NYSERDA, Richman, and Cyndi Lauper for your commitment, concern and compelling drive to make this important project a reality. Our community is all the stronger for it.\"", "tag-6": "\"I am proud today to celebrate the historic opening of True Colors Residence \u2013 the state's first permanent, supportive housing facility for formerly homeless LGBT youth,\" said Manhattan Borough President Scott Stringer. \"At a time when we as a society should be doing so much more to support these young people, the opening of this remarkable facility is proof that we can help meet the need by working together. Thanks are due to Cyndi Lauper and her manager Lisa Barbaris, who supported the establishment of this residence, and I am proud that my office provided funding to West End to support this endeavor as well. But our work is not yet done: There are thousands of homeless LGBT youth in New York, and our shelters for this group have waitlists in the hundreds. Let the opening of True Colors Residence send a message: Here in New York we are united in our determination to address and solve this problem.\"", "tag-7": "The newly completed building is an energy-efficient six-story multifamily building with 30 studio apartments plus one unit for an on-site super and will be available to tenants earning not more than 50 percent of the Area Median Income (AMI), or what is equivalent to an annual income of $27,750 for a single person. True Colors Residence also includes indoor and outdoor community space for residents, a computer room, a resource library and support services for the young adults.", "tag-8": "\"It is thrilling to finally be able to open our doors and welcome our first residents,\" said West End Executive Director Colleen Jackson. \"We hope True Colors Residence will be a model to be replicated so that homeless LGBT youth will have more affordable and supportive permanent housing available to them. There is much to be done for this underserved population, but thanks to the people who believed in our dream we are getting the ball rolling. To all those who have helped finance this incredible project, including our major funders and supporters, and of course our partners Lisa Barbaris and Cyndi Lauper, we extend our heartfelt gratitude.\"", "tag-9": "\"The opening of the True Colors Residence marks a special moment in which so many people joined together to meet the growing need for housing for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender youth dealing with homelessness,\" said Ms. Lauper. \"I want to especially thank Colleen Jackson and the West End Intergenerational Residence for making this dream a reality. I look forward to witnessing the indelible impact that the Residence will make. By having a permanent roof over their heads and support available to them, I am confident that these young people will become the adults they hope and deserve to be.\"", "tag-10": "True Colors Residence's total development cost of $11 million was funded from a variety of sources.
