Excluding these divestiture-related impacts, earnings per share was $1.505.", "tag-6": "Revenues increased 6% from the prior-year period, primarily due to the gain on sale of the Philippines consumer business versus a loss on sale of the Australia consumer business in the prior-year period. Excluding these divestiture-related impacts, revenues were down 1%5, as growth in net interest income was more than offset by lower non-interest revenues. On this basis, higher net interest income was driven by the impact of higher interest rates across businesses and strong loan growth in Personal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM). This was more than offset by lower non-interest revenues reflecting declines in Investment Banking and Markets in Institutional Clients Group (ICG) and investment product revenues in Global Wealth Management in PBWM.", "tag-7": "Net income of $3.5 billion decreased 25% from the prior-year period, primarily driven by higher cost of credit resulting from the loan growth in PBWM and higher operating expenses.", "tag-8": "Earnings per share of $1.63 decreased 24% from the prior-year period, reflecting the lower net income, partially offset by an approximate 4% decline in average diluted shares outstanding.", "tag-9": "Citi CEO Jane Fraser said, \u201cWe are intensely focused on supporting our clients and executing our strategy. We have made good progress on many of the core business drivers we laid out at Investor Day, despite the complex macro environment. Treasury and Trade Solutions saw revenues up 40% year-over-year, with growth across all segments, and Securities Services was up 15%. In Fixed Income, we matched last year\u2019s showing through our strength in FX, while Equities came in lower than last year. Banking was the business most adversely impacted by the macro environment with reduced deal flows and a lower appetite for M&A. While the backdrop for wealth management was difficult, our revenues were up outside of Asia. U.S. Personal Banking further solidified its growth trajectory with double digit revenue growth in both of our cards businesses.", "tag-10": "\u201cWe continue to shrink our operations in and exposure to Russia and we will be ending nearly all of the institutional banking services we offer next quarter.

Going forward, Citi\u2019s only operations in Russia will be those necessary to fulfill its remaining legal and regulatory obligations.

At quarter end, Citigroup\u2019s CET1 Capital ratio was 12.2% versus 11.9% in the second quarter 2022, reflecting the benefits of the net income, the sale of the Philippines consumer business and the optimization of risk-weighted assets (RWA), partly offset by interest rate impacts on unrealized available-for-sale securities losses through Citigroup\u2019s investment portfolio and changes in deferred tax assets.

Fixed Income Markets revenues of $3.1 billion increased 1%, as strength in rates and currencies was largely offset by continued headwinds in spread products. Equity Markets revenues of $1.0 billion were down 25%, primarily reflecting reduced client activity in equity derivatives relative to a very strong quarter in the prior-year period.", "tag-29": "Banking revenues of $1.2 billion decreased 50%, including losses on loan hedges in the current quarter and the prior-year period. Excluding losses on loan hedges, Banking revenues of $1.3 billion decreased 49%, driven by lower revenues in Investment Banking and Corporate Lending.
