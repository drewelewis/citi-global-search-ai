Such occurrences are rare but they are rewarding.", "tag-3": "Cyclically adjusted earnings have removed the debate around peak earnings, while futures contracts on Treasuries do the same for potentially artificial immediate yield depressants. By looking at a P/E ratio on 10-year rolling average EPS, investors can better understand the earnings yield without having to modify valuation criteria around projected peak profit or margin arguments. Similarly, investors can use the five-year forward contract on 10-year Treasury yields to correct for near-term influences such as safe haven demand or current Fed policy.", "tag-4": "The earnings yield gap of 10-year rolling EPS and the five-year forward yield look very compelling. At two to three standard deviations below its average since 1970, stocks have a 96% historical probability of forward 12-month market appreciation with historical median and average 20%+ gains. Hence, the view of the S&P 500 opportunity for 2012 remains very constructive, in our view."}
