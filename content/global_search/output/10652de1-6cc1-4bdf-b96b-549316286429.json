The program was launched and highlighted during an event at Finanta headquarters at which Philadelphia Mayor Michael A. Nutter announced a $2.3 million commitment to a group of community organizations providing small business assistance.", "tag-4": "The unique set of challenges faced by underserved and under-banked entrepreneurs\u2014many of whom are immigrants and/or low-income earners living in distressed communities\u2014is experienced in an especially acute way in Philadelphia, which has a rapidly growing immigrant community. According to the 2010 Census, almost 22 percent of Philadelphia's 1.54 million residents are language or ethnic minorities, up from 9 percent in 2000. Foreign-born individuals often experience greater difficulties opening bank accounts, establishing credit histories and building good credit scores.", "tag-5": "The innovative Circles of Success program was created to help Philadelphia jumpstart entrepreneurship, which has been shown to be an especially effective way for low-wealth or under-employed individuals to generate income, build assets and achieve financial security. Building on the histories and inherent strengths of both organizations\u2014which have a combined 37 years of experience working in the credit building and microfinance space\u2014Finanta will work with Spanish-speaking micro and small business owners who have limited English language proficiency and Entrepreneur Works will focus its efforts primarily on the Afro-Caribbean business community. The program is expected to serve more than 100 underserved small-business owners in the Philadelphia area.", "tag-6": "\"By connecting the microloan process with credit building, this program contributes to the long-term viability of entrepreneurs, their businesses and the jobs they provide,\" said Mayor Nutter. \"My administration always seeks to work together with the private, nonprofit and public sectors in innovative ways to ensure a stable foundation for Philadelphia's businesses.\"", "tag-7": "Finanta and Entrepreneur Works will make loans of between $1,000 and $20,000 to program participants; successful repayment will be reported through the formal credit reporting system in order to directly build the participants' credit scores. Thus, the program not only will support the development of Philadelphia-area microbusinesses in the short term but also will enable underserved entrepreneurs to build credit so they can access more sources of financing and lower the cost of the capital and services needed to grow their businesses. The two organizations also will provide coaching and financial education to program participants. Circles of Success will be funded by a $125,000 Citi Community Development grant to support both the initial pilot and the development of a national framework for replication.", "tag-8": "\"This program is an innovative and effective way to enable underserved entrepreneurs to overcome the barriers to forming good credit and accessing mainstream markets and sources of capital,\" said Donald L. Haskin, Pennsylvania State Director for Citi Community Development. \"Particularly during periods of high poverty and unemployment, it's imperative for us to empower more entrepreneurs \u2014 many of whom are immigrants, low-income earners and living in distressed communities \u2014 to provide financial stability for themselves and their families and to create jobs.", "tag-9": "\"Increasingly, a strong credit score is an asset that is often required for employment and access to a greater range of lower-cost services and products,\" said Luis Mora, executive director of Finanta. \"Through this program, we will work with microentrepreneurs to build this asset as well as their businesses, so that they can increase their economic opportunities.\"", "tag-10": "\"This microlending program will make innovative use of the Rotating Savings and Credit Association (ROSCA) model, a peer-based banking arrangement in which small groups of individual entrepreneurs work together to contribute to a common loan fund and decide lending limits among themselves,\" said Entrepreneur Works CEO Leslie Benoliel. \"Here, we are pioneering an innovative and replicable implementation of a model that is commonly used informally in rural areas of underdeveloped countries.\"", "tag-11": "Finanta Finanta promotes the growth and economic expansion of diverse Philadelphia communities through the infusion of capital and provision of business consultation services and homeownership counseling.
