But the value of a college degree remains significant, as college-educated workers earn 70% more than non-college-educated peers.", "tag-4": "Since 2013, Citi Community Development has been working behind the scenes to support Moneythink, a Chicago-based nonprofit, to bring tech-enhanced financial coaching to more than 5,500 students. In the high-touch field of community work, this new approach has proved helpful in ensuring that many more students achieve higher-education success.", "tag-5": "As nearly three-quarters of teenagers have access to smartphones, Moneythink created a mobile app that prepares young people for the financial realities of saving for, paying for and benefitting from college. In the Moneythink app, students are rewarded for completing challenges through a points system that puts them in competition with peers, and encourages an online dialogue \u2013 emoticons are welcome! The challenges include taking a picture of a spending or saving moment, posting photos or videos of the banking services they use, and posting a screenshot of a text exchange they've had with a family member about their finances.", "tag-6": "The app is effective because student have conversations with peers \u2013 and financial counselors \u2013 about their financial choices.", "tag-7": "To expand the number of students who could benefit from the app, and ensure the innovation could scale, Citi Community Development is supporting Moneythink's work to build out the backend platform that will enable it to be replicated for use by other community partners.", "tag-8": "The next step for Moneythink is to partner with schools and other community organizations to increase the number of students using it. Most recently, Citi Community Development supported Moneythink to provide its services at Perspectives Charter School, 90% of whose students reside in low-income households. Moneythink aims to increase the number of students filling out the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, choosing and attending best-match schools, and persisting through college. The students use the app to do a cost-benefit analysis for choosing the right college or university.", "tag-9": "Moneythink is reflection of Citi Community Development's strategy of building a more inclusive financial services industry."}
