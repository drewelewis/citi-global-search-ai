Through this partnership with Citi, IFF will develop a turnkey solution for the design, development and financing of community health centers. Our goal will be speed and simplicity\u2014and to develop a model that will prove transformative for communities across the Midwest and nation.\"", "tag-5": "\"CDFIs like IFF are expert in providing responsible, creative low-cost financing solutions for critical community needs,\" said Laura Sparks, Director of Development Finance Initiatives for Citi Community Development. \"We look forward to working with IFF to help meet the important need for low-cost, high-quality community-based health care infrastructure. We believe that IFF has the track record to successfully develop and finance projects that respond to this urgent need in the Midwest and to develop a model for other communities across the country. This goes beyond creating new capacity for low-cost, high-quality health care. It also creates job opportunities, incorporates 'green' construction and spurs other community development projects as these centers stimulate their local economies.\"", "tag-6": "Citi CEO Vikram Pandit met with the leaders of IFF and other Midwestern CDFIs in the spring of 2011 to learn about local needs so that Citi could develop solutions. IFF will use Citi's contribution to create a new development model by cultivating community partnerships; further developing its project pipeline and financing structures; and developing a robust knowledge base around public funding sources and policy dynamics. To lead Health Centers for Healthy Communities, IFF has recruited James L. Murphy, formerly the Director of Strategic Affiliations of ACCESS Community Health Network, the largest network of community health centers in Illinois, with more than 50 clinics in the Chicago area.
