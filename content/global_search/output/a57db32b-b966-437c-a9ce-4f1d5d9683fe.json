They have $400,000 in long-term corporate bonds that are yielding 5%, giving them $20,000 in annual interest.", "tag-3": "Their retirement-income strategy is simple enough: They plan to spend that $20,000, as well as any money they receive from Social Security. This may sound safe enough. But they could be headed for big trouble.", "tag-4": "How come? Our hypothetical couple may find themselves caught between inflation on the one hand and longevity risk on the other.", "tag-5": "Let's assume inflation is running at 3% a year. While our couple's Social Security benefit should rise each year along with inflation, their interest income will likely remain at around $20,000--which means their standard of living will slide as inflation climbs. Indeed, after 13 years, their interest income will have lost almost a third of its spending power.", "tag-6": "To ensure their income keeps pace with inflation, our couple might opt not only to spend their interest, but also to sell part of their bond holdings each year. For instance, in year two of their retirement, they would need to boost their portfolio withdrawal from $20,000 to $20,600 to keep up with our assumed 3% inflation rate, and that would necessitate selling a small amount of bonds.", "tag-7": "This might not sound like a big deal. But the combination of ever-rising income needs and an ever-shrinking portfolio eventually takes its toll. If one or both members of our couple live until age 89, they would have a serious financial problem--because that's the year they would run out of money.", "tag-8": "To combat that threat, our couple might consider a change of strategy, such as taking more risk in pursuit of higher returns or using part of their savings to purchase an annuity that gives them a lifetime stream of income. Alternatively, they might stick with bonds but start out by spending less, so they're reinvesting part of their interest income during their early retirement years. If our couple spent $16,000 of their bond interest in the first year of retirement and thereafter increased the sum they pulled from their portfolio along with inflation, they wouldn't run out of money until age 98.", "tag-9": "INVESTMENT PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022 NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-10": "This hypothetical is for illustrative purposes only. These strategies do not necessarily represent the experience of other clients, nor do they guarantee or predict future performance or success. Investment results may vary. The investment strategies presented are not appropriate for every investor.", "tag-11": "Bonds are affected by a number of risks, including fluctuations in interest rates, credit risk and prepayment risk. In general, as prevailing interest rates rise, fixed income securities prices will fall. Bonds face credit risk if a decline in an issuer's credit rating, or creditworthiness, causes a bond's price to decline. High yield bonds are subject to additional risks such as increased risk of default and greater volatility because of the lower credit quality of the issues. Finally, bonds can be subject to prepayment risk. When interest rates fall, an issuer may choose to borrow money at a lower interest rate, while paying off its previously issued bonds. As a consequence, underlying bonds will lose the interest payments from the investment and will be forced to reinvest in a market where prevailing interest rates are lower than when the initial investment was made.", "tag-12": "\u00a9 2012 Citigroup Inc.
