We Listened.", "summary": "<strong>An Update for our Customers</strong>", "tag-1": "You Spoke. We Listened.", "tag-2": "An Update for our Customers", "tag-3": "When you talk, we listen. While we're proud to celebrate Citi's 200-year history in 2012, we know there is more to do. We want to share an update on some of the things we've recently heard from you and what we've done about it, such as providing more ways to earn and use rewards and easier ways to manage your account.", "tag-4": "You told us that getting more from your miles when traveling is important to you. This month, together with American Airlines, we added new benefits to the Citi\u00ae Platinum Select\u00ae / AAdvantage\u00ae card, the only credit card that offers 10% miles back for AAdvantage\u00ae miles redeemed, up to 10,000 miles per calendar year. The new benefits save time in the airport and money, with free first checked bag and priority boarding for customers and up to four traveling companions - a family with four checked bags would save $200 roundtrip on baggage fees.", "tag-5": "We've also heard that you want more ways to use your ThankYou points. In January, we launched the industry's first app which lets you share ThankYou points with your friends on Facebook who are also ThankYou members. Our ThankYou Point Sharing app is a fun, social way to pool points towards a bigger goal - whether it's donating to a common charitable cause or booking a weekend away with friends. Our ThankYou cards let you earn unlimited points that do not expire, and we're proud that ThankYou Preferred was recognized by Kiplinger's Personal Finance as one of the best rewards credit cards.", "tag-6": "You wanted easier ways to manage your accounts. We just introduced the new Citibank (Kindle Fire Edition) banking app which lets you plan, track and analyze your finances. Our Citibank for iPad\u00ae app, which was recognized as a \"Staff Favorite\" on the App Store(SM) and by Forrester Research, now includes new credit card account analysis and tracking tools. We've also added new ways to use the Citi Mobile app, such as the ability to send money to anyone with an email address, and to deposit checks directly into your Citibank personal checking account from your mobile phone.", "tag-7": "We've also been working on improving the fundamentals. You've told us that it wasn't as easy as it should be to pay your bills online. This simply shouldn't be the case - so we fixed it. We added Online Bill Pay features so you can schedule a payment in advance and change a payment due date with just a few clicks. We are also working hard to further simplify your statement and further minimize point-of-sale interruptions in the coming months.", "tag-8": "Every day we work to earn your business, and we're constantly listening. We'll keep sharing updates, and ask that you keep sharing feedback with us so that we can better meet your needs ... and ultimately, wow you as a Citi cardmember."}
