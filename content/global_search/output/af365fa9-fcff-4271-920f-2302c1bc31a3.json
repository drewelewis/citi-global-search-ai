A new Citi survey reveals a startling reality: 90% of U.S. adults express confidence in their ability to detect and prevent financial scams, yet more than a quarter (27%) of 2,432 online respondents report falling victim at some point. This disconnect emphasizes the need for continued vigilance, awareness and education to keep consumers' finances safe.", "tag-4": "\"Today's scammers are nimble, well-organized and aided by sophisticated tools,\" said Michael Steinbach, Head of Financial Crimes and Fraud Prevention at Citi. \"Scammers often deal in volume, and it only takes one successful attempt to profit. They are counting on you to be too busy or confident to spot red flags \u2014 and the consequences can be financially devastating. Particularly during the holiday season when scammers are very active, it's important to remain vigilant, listen to your instincts and turn to trustworthy sources of fraud and scam information to protect yourself.\"\u00a0\u00a0Part of the problem is the proliferation and sophistication of scams.\u00a0Americans reported $8.8 billion in scam losses to the Federal Trade Commission in 2022 \u2014 a 30% increase over 2021. While Citi's data found that most Americans are familiar with standard scamming methods like phishing (54%) and bank impersonation (51%), more than 1 in 10 (13%) couldn't identify any of the 14 common scams presented to them in the survey. Of course, familiarity with scams isn't necessarily preventing Americans from succumbing to them. 32% of Gen Z report being victims of financial scams \u2014 the highest of any age group.\u00a0\u00a0The consequences of scams can be severe. \u00a0The survey from Citi also revealed that more than 7 in 10 (71%) adults who fell victim to a scam say it impacted their financial health, such as setting back their savings (38%), sending them into debt or deeper into debt (29%), or lowering their credit score (18%). Survey respondents report taking several measures after a scam, including blocking the scammers (45%), changing their passwords (37%) and contacting their banks (37%).\u00a0\u00a0You can help prevent scams before they happen. Here's how.\u00a0The good news? Americans are taking steps to avoid scams, including getting actionable advice from a trusted source. When asked whom they trust most for fraud and scam prevention information, a majority (55%) cited their bank among their top three. Your bank is a wise place to start if you need help determining where to turn to protect yourself from scammers.\u00a0\u00a0However, only two-thirds (67%) routinely check their account statements and credit scores to monitor for unusual activity. What's more, 1 in 10 Americans report employing none of the scam prevention tactics presented to them in the survey. \u00a0\u00a0Citi is your partner in the fight against scams.
