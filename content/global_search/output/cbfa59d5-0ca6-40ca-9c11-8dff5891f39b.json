It's a complex document that often keeps students who need this funding the most from receiving it. Students that fill out the FAFSA are 50 percent more likely to attend college. That's where we can help.\"", "tag-6": "Mayor Cory Booker and the Newark City Council proclaimed Financial Aid Awareness Week in Newark to help heighten awareness of the issue, for families who may be missing out on financial aid as well as policymakers who can make the process easier to understand. Financial Aid U programs have been instrumental in passing similar resolutions in other major cities across the country.", "tag-7": "\"The financial barrier to obtaining a college degree can be overcome for many through the support of programs like FAU,\" said Council Vice President Anibal Ramos. \"Too often the value of education is underestimated, and in today's economy obtaining a college degree can pay off greatly. For example someone with a Bachelor's degree has an average income that is almost 66 percent more than someone that only graduated high school. In addition, those with a bachelor's are also half as likely to be unemployed than someone that is just a high school graduate. For the average person this can be almost a $1 million more earned in one's lifetime. \"", "tag-8": "\"In these challenging economic times, it is more important than ever that our college-bound students receive every penny of financial aid for which they are entitled,\" said Mayor Cory Booker. \"I urge all of our residents to take advantage of Newark Now's Financial Aid Awareness Week and visit the Financial Empowerment Center to learn about programs, scholarships, and grants that are available to them, so that they can manifest their personal excellence by achieving higher education.\"", "tag-9": "With nationwide college attendance rates for low-income households lagging 20 to 40 percent behind their higher-income counterparts, completion of the FAFSA form is recognized as a major barrier for students and their families as they struggle to understand how to finance their college educations.", "tag-10": "Last year, Financial Aid U programs helped more than 1,200 students complete a FAFSA, generating $10.7 million in federal assistance and an additional $4.3 million in low-interest student loans.", "tag-11": "\"Eighty percent of today's fastest-growing careers require a postsecondary degree. As the job market grows more competitive, those without a college degree could be left further behind,\" said Helen Steblecki, Senior Vice President and Director of Community Development for Citi in New Jersey. \"By supporting low-income and first generation students and their families through this critical step on the path to college, we will help more of them realize their college dreams and build successful careers.\"", "tag-12": "Newark NOW is a member of the National Community Tax Coalition (NCTC), the nation's largest membership network of community based organizations offering free tax and financial services to low-income working families.

Financial coaches at Newark NOW have been assisting low-income individuals to file their income tax returns, and then using that information to complete a FAFSA for the client. In addition, Newark NOW made the FAFSA assistance service available at several local high schools where students were invited to complete their applications with guidance from trained volunteers. High schools participating in this outreach service were Arts, Barringer, Science Park, Technology, University and East Side. This year Newark Now has been able to assist over 350 students with completion of the FAFSA and other college access issues.", "tag-14": "To learn more about Financial Aid U, visit http://tax-coalition.org/program-tools/financial-services/financial-education/federal-student-aid/financial-aid-u-1/financial-aid-u.", "tag-15": "Newark Now Newark Mayor Cory A.
