This program has, to date, provided financing to 29 microfinance institutions in 16 countries, directly reaching more than 330,000 local micro-entrepreneurs through small loans, with approximately 84% being women. We are also developing new financial capabilities that enable new distribution models to access micro-entrepreneurs in the developing markets.", "tag-4": "This recognition is a significant milestone in our Responsible Finance journey. We congratulate and thank our colleagues across Citi's businesses that have contributed to this effort and Citi's triple bottom line."}
