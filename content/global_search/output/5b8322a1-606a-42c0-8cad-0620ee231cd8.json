The primary purpose of the project is to prevent children being taken away from women who face difficult situations in life for financial reasons. Named \"Financial Literacy for Mothers and Women in Shelters,\" the project aims to help these women address their existing difficult situation and regain control of their lives, in effect becoming able to raise their children so they can grow up in their biological families.", "tag-1": "Czech Republic: Citi Foundation and Tereza Maxov\u00e1 Foundation Pilot Project Aims To Provide Financial Education to Mothers in Shelters", "tag-2": "Prague \u2013 The Citi Foundation and Tereza Maxov\u00e1 Foundation launched a pilot project aimed at improving financial literacy among mothers and women living in shelters in the Czech Republic this summer.

The Citi Foundation has been focusing on the topic of improving financial literacy in our society for a long time, and so our joint project with Tereza Maxov\u00e1 Foundation is a logical extension of our activities in this area.\"", "tag-5": "Involving some 40 mothers living in shelters in its pilot phase (July 2013 \u2013 June 2014), the project aims to bring about a positive change in those women's financial habits and has the ambition to give them the opportunities and tools to change their situation step by step. Spanning 10 months, the project will run in shelters in Vset\u00edn and Most where groups of mothers participating in the project will be set up. The project will be divided into three parts \u2013 theoretical, practical and evaluation. Every participant in the project will have her own individual plan focusing on several criteria.", "tag-6": "The evaluation of the theoretical part will, among other things, focus on the women's involvement in the lectures, understanding of the various topics, willingness to gain new information and ability to use it in practice. Lecture topics are designed to help mothers to build sound habits in handling money. Topics will include: saving your finances; who is a consumer and how to protect yourself; financial planning; money management; household budget; and debt relief.", "tag-7": "The hands-on part will run in parallel with the theoretical part and women will make various products (jewels, home shoes, ceramics, dolls with a story, etc.) that they will subsequently sell in order to generate profit.", "tag-8": "For the evaluation part of the project, every participating shelter will submit reports on the evaluation and developments in working with various women. At the end, the pilot project will be evaluated and its rules modified as the case may be in order to enable its subsequent launch on a larger scale, in multiple shelters across the Czech Republic.", "tag-9": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
