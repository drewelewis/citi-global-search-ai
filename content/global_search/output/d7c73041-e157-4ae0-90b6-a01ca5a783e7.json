Citi recently acknowledged the innovative contributions of its corporate realty suppliers after an Earth Day Supplier Summit.", "tag-3": "With a corporate real-estate portfolio of 12,000 sites in more than 100 countries, the company has aggressive goals for reducing its environmental footprint.", "tag-4": "Citi began measuring the environmental impact of its facilities and publicly released its first carbon-footprint-reduction goal in 2006. In 2010, the Citi Realty Services (CRS) team expanded on the company's existing goals by creating additional targets for 2015 that include: reducing GHG emissions from buildings by 25 percent, reducing waste to landfill by 40 percent, reducing water use by 20 percent and having 15 percent of its real-estate portfolio LEED-certified by the U.S. Green Building Council1.", "tag-5": "\"A logical next step for us was ensuring the sustainability of our supply chain,\" said John Killey, Global Head of Building Operations. \"Citi's customers have embraced green efforts \u2013 from corporate clients working with us on socially and environmentally friendly lending principles, to individual consumers opting for paperless statements. Now we have set expectations for our vendors to help us drive our sustainable performance as well.\"", "tag-6": "As part of its strategy to integrate ethical, social and environmental factors into its global procurement practices and to positively influence suppliers, Citi launched a Sustainable Supplier Program in 2009.", "tag-7": "One innovative example of how a vendor is helping Citi reach its environmental targets is the rePurpose program developed by furniture manufacturer Herman Miller. Herman Miller worked with Citi's team to design durable, cost-effective furniture for a branch environment that met or exceeded LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) standards, and then, through the rePurpose program, ensured that the old branch furniture was refurbished and donated by Citi to local community non-profits like Habitat for Humanity, rather than discarded into a landfill. This collaborative program resulted in 159 tons of waste diverted from landfill and the donation of slightly less than 4,000 pieces of furniture to deserving families.", "tag-8": "\"Meeting our sustainability goals requires collaboration with employees, customers and vendors,\" said I. Javette Hines, head of Citi's Supplier Diversity and Sustainability Program. \"It's a priority we all share. Citi's program will continue to drive even more benefits as our vendors continue to explore sustainable solutions. Citi will benefit, customers and employees will benefit, and shareholders will benefit.\"", "tag-9": "More information about Citi's environmental sustainability efforts is available at http://www.citigroup.com/citi/citizen/operations/index.htm.", "tag-10": "Citi Citi, the leading global financial services company, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
