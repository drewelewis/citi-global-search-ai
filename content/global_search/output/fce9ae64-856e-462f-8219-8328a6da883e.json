These are just some of the ways we're working to be as environmentally responsible as possible.\"", "tag-7": "\"Citi is a 200-year-old company that continues to thrive because of its resourcefulness and willingness to lead in areas like environmental stewardship,\" said Rick Fedrizzi, President, CEO and Founding Chair, U.S. Green Building Council. \"Citi has demonstrated a company-wide dedication to economic, environmental and human health by embedding LEED principles into its design and refurbishment process.\"", "tag-8": "Citi, which turned 200 years old on June 16, was one of the first global financial services companies to publicly join the fight to slow climate change and reduce its energy dependence.
