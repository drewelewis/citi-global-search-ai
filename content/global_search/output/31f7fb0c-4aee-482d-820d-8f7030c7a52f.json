Other activities included face painting, live art demonstrations and samba dancers. And it wouldn't have been Rio without a beach and some volleyball courts.", "tag-4": "More than 25,000 people visited Rio on the Hudson, including more than 2,300 children, from day camps and community groups. Many of the visitors had an opportunity to mingle with past and current Team Citi athletes, including U.S. Olympians Christine Rampone, Mia Hamm and Dominique Dawes, U.S. Paralympian Rudy Garcia-Tolson and Paralympic hopeful Scout Bassett. The event provided a great way for those who couldn't make it to the games in Brazil to experience a taste of the Rio Olympic experience in NYC.", "tag-5": "Additional Photos:"}
