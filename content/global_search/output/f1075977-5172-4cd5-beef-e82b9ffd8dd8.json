Citi took top marks in two of those areas: design, which focuses on the way Citi's businesses and functions are aligned in defining and supporting our citizenship objectives; and transparency, which highlights how Citi communicates and shares its goals, achievements and best practices with the public and with our peers and partners. We also took the #2 spots for measurement & strategy, leadership, and employee civic growth.", "tag-6": "Citi's citizenship efforts revolve around three pillars: financial inclusion, environmental sustainability, and valuing and supporting our employees. By focusing on these three areas, Citi is able to leverage its expertise and its people to enable progress in the communities we serve.
