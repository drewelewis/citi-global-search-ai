They effectively earn a pre-tax return equal to their mortgage rate, which might be 5% or 6%. They reduce the amount of debt they're carrying. And it's as simple as adding maybe $50 or $100 to the monthly mortgage check.", "tag-1": "Matters of principal.", "tag-2": "Many homeowners make extra-principal payments with a view to paying off their mortgage more quickly -- and it's easy to understand why. They effectively earn a pre-tax return equal to their mortgage rate, which might be 5% or 6%. They reduce the amount of debt they're carrying. And it's as simple as adding maybe $50 or $100 to the monthly mortgage check.", "tag-3": "Paying down debt can be particularly compelling as you approach retirement. If you pay off the mortgage entirely, you eliminate a major expense. Even if the mortgage isn't paid off completely by retirement, you'll have more home equity, which you could tap into by trading down or taking out a reverse mortgage.", "tag-4": "Still, before making extra-principal payments, you may want to take advantage of the various retirement accounts available to you. While paying down your home loan will reduce your tax-deductible mortgage interest, funding retirement accounts will often give you tax benefits.", "tag-5": "For instance, traditional 401(k) plans and Individual Retirement Accounts can give an initial tax deduction and tax-deferred growth, plus the 401(k) may also offer a matching employer contribution. Meanwhile, there's no initial tax deduction with Roth 401(k) plans and IRAs, but all withdrawals in retirement can be tax-free. On top of these advantages, you will have the investment return you earn, which could potentially be higher than your mortgage's after-tax cost.", "tag-6": "If you have college-bound children, there may be an added incentive to putting the funding of retirement accounts ahead of extra-mortgage payments: While some private colleges consider home equity when determining financial-aid eligibility, retirement accounts are typically ignored.", "tag-7": "What if you've maxed out on your various retirement accounts? At that juncture, paying down your home loan could be a smart strategy if you're a conservative investor. But you may be able to earn higher returns if you're willing to take more risk and invest your extra savings in the financial markets.", "tag-8": "INVESTMENT PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022 NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-9": "The information provided here is for informational purposes only.
