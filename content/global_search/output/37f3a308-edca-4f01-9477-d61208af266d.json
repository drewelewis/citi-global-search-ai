Reliable crop watering methods and innovative tools can mean the difference between break-even sustenance farming and an income-producing livelihood.", "tag-1": "Increasing Crop Yields and Incomes for Smallholder Farmers in Africa", "tag-2": "Irrigation has tremendous potential to increase productivity, raise income levels for smallholder farmers in Africa, and provide a sustainable solution to the rural poor's most important need - a way to consistently earn money. Reliable crop watering methods and innovative tools can mean the difference between break-even sustenance farming and an income-producing livelihood.", "tag-3": "Last week, KickStart announced a collaboration between Citi and the Skoll Foundation that will enable our organization to scale our efforts to alleviate poverty. A working capital loan to KickStart, the first from Citi directed to the social enterprise sector, will boost the capacity of smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa, where farm yields are among the lowest in the world. Crucial support from the Skoll Foundation made the arrangement possible.", "tag-4": "Since KickStart launched, we've sold nearly 225,000 human-powered irrigation pumps that provide smallholder farmers with the means to irrigate their crops regularly and cheaply. But the raw number of pumps we've sold isn't the real story -rather, it is the transformational change that poor farmers experience and the sustainable impacts our work has triggered. KickStart has developed a systematic, replicable model for addressing poverty, and clearly defined methods to continually measure our impacts. Starting with a comprehensive database of pump purchasers, we select a sample of farmers to visit in the field at set intervals (immediately after purchase, 18 months later, and again 36 months after purchase) and collect key indicators like family income, health, and education.", "tag-5": "Through surveys and the longitudinal data we compile, KickStart continues to demonstrate that we're making an impact. Since we started tracking results, KickStart has helped create 150,000 enterprises and moved 750,000 people out of poverty in Kenya, Tanzania, Mali, Burkina Faso, Zambia and 15 other countries across sub-Saharan Africa.", "tag-6": "Support from partners like Citi Microfinance, Citi Commercial Bank, and the Skoll Foundation, in combination with donor funding, is crucial to making all of this happen. To really reach scale, we need philanthropic support and financing, as well as the credibility that comes from working with organizations known for making smart decisions for their clients and partners. Thanks to partners like Citi and the Skoll Foundation, we're on our way to reaching even more smallholder farmers, improving their lives and breaking the cycle of poverty."}
