It was not until mid-1948 that the bank reopened the Paris branch of the International Banking Corporation, its foreign banking subsidiary. This coincided with the setting-up of the Economic Cooperation Administration by the United States, to run its European Recovery Program for Western Europe. Under this initiative, later known as the Marshall Plan, National City Bank arranged a large number of commercial letters of credit for shipments to countries receiving U.S. government aid. By the time the program came to an end in 1951, the United States had channeled almost $13 billion to Western European countries and Turkey. The main recipients were Britain, France, and the new Federal Republic of Germany, where the bank established a representative office in Frankfurt at the beginning of 1953."}
