But diversification has its limits. To understand those limits, consider the crucial distinction between \"specific\" and \"systematic\" risk.", "tag-3": "Specific risk is the risk that comes with owning any one stock. For example, if all you owned were shares in one company, you would be fully exposed to that stock's specific risk. If the company got into financial trouble and its shares went to zero, so too would your portfolio.", "tag-4": "If you own stocks of a few more companies in the same industry, your specific risk would be somewhat reduced. But your portfolio could still be badly bloodied if the industry involved suffered a slowdown.", "tag-5": "What if you owned a whole slew of stocks from a host of different industries and countries? You likely would eliminate the specific risk related to any particular stock. But you would still be exposed to systematic risk, which is the risk associated with the entire market. The 2008-2009 market collapse gave investors a painful reminder of what systematic risk can look like--and, to a lesser degree, so too has the recent market swoon.", "tag-6": "The bottom line: By spreading your money across a wide variety of stocks, you can reduce the risk associated with any particular company, industry or national stock market, and that can be a smart thing to do. But even if you are diversified, you will likely lose money if the broad stock market turns lower--which is why you may want to own more conservative securities, such as bonds and cash investments, and why it's important to prepare yourself mentally for rough times.", "tag-7": "INVESTMENT PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-8": "The information provided is solely for informational purposes.
