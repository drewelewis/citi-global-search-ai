One of the stipulations for this approval is that Citi will be required to increase its estimated risk-weighted assets (RWA) associated with operational risk to $288 billion from the $232 billion reported as of December 31, 2013, given the overall operating environment for the banking industry. The estimated pro forma impact of the higher operational risk RWA to Citi's estimated Basel III Tier 1 Common Capital ratio as of December 31, 2013 results in a pro forma ratio of approximately 10.1%.", "tag-1": "Citigroup Statement on Basel III Advanced Approach Reporting", "tag-2": "New York \u2013 The Federal Reserve Board has announced that Citi has been approved to exit parallel Basel III reporting for U.S. regulatory capital purposes and transition from the general risk-based capital rules (Basel I) to Basel III \"advanced approaches,\" effective for the second quarter of 2014.

While changes in operational risk RWA impact the denominator of Citi's Basel III Tier 1 Common Capital ratio, they do not impact Citi's Basel III Tier 1 Capital or the SLR. As a result, even with the higher operational risk RWA, Citi can remain in compliance with the proposed SLR requirement at a lower Basel III Tier 1 Common Capital ratio. Therefore, Citi management has revised its estimated Basel III Tier 1 Common capital target ratio to 9.5%, which remains approximately 50 basis points above Citi's expected required minimum Basel III Tier 1 Common Capital ratio on a fully phased-in basis.", "tag-4": "Accordingly, reflecting these changes, as of December 31, 2013, Citi's pro forma estimated Basel III Tier 1 Common Capital ratio was 10.1%, compared to a revised target of 9.5%, and Citi's estimated SLR was 5.4%, compared to the proposed requirement of 5.0%(1).", "tag-5": "(1) Citi's estimated Basel III Tier 1 Common Capital ratio as of December 31, 2013 and target Basel III Tier 1 Common Capital ratio are based on the \"advanced approaches\" for determining RWA.", "tag-6": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions. Citi provides consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, transaction services, and wealth management.", "tag-7": "Additional information may be found at www.citigroup.com | Twitter: @Citi | YouTube: www.youtube.com/citi | Blog: http://blog.citigroup.com | Facebook: www.facebook.com/citi | LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/citi", "tag-8": "Certain statements in this press release, including Citi's ability to remain in compliance with the proposed SLR requirement and its target and expected minimum Basel III Tier 1 Common Capital ratio, are \"forward-looking statements\" within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
