Building owners can put the funds toward resiliency measures, like installing state-of-the-art heating and electric plants that are repositioned to withstand the next storm by being located on higher floors and/or in waterproof compartments.

Steel. \"The preservation and long-term health of our multifamily housing stock is vital to keeping New York City livable and sustainable.\"", "tag-6": "\"This fund will go a long way toward helping us fulfill our mission to return every resident displaced by Sandy to permanent housing, and it will have the added benefit of helping building owners rebuild stronger and smarter,\" said Housing Recovery Operations Director Gair.", "tag-7": "\"It is critical that owners of multifamily buildings have the resources available to get back up and running as quickly as possible,\" said Commissioner Wambua. \"The Storm Recovery Loan Fund uses City resources to leverage private dollars at below market rates. We are grateful for the commitment our partners have shown in helping fellow New Yorkers rebuild after Sandy.

Creating this pilot program from this pool of funds to serve those who have been harmed by Hurricane Sandy is the best thing we can do right now,\" HDC President Jahr said. \"Together we are expanding the boundaries of what is possible, and together is how we will make these transactions work for the owners, the tenants, as well as the long-term resiliency of these multi-family buildings.\"", "tag-9": "HDC will provide a 10 percent first loss credit enhancement on construction loans financed through the program. In this pilot phase, the majority of applications for the Storm Recovery Loan Fund will be primarily for buildings between five and 45 units, although larger buildings will be considered. Applications are accepted on a rolling basis and funding is available both to repair storm damage and to mitigate the potential impact of future storms.", "tag-10": "\"Although Superstorm Sandy occurred almost two months ago, thousands of multifamily residents are unable to go home or are living in apartments with significant storm damage. Building owners want to quickly repair and protect their buildings from future storms. CPC's core mission is to create sound rental housing for lower income families and to rebuild communities, so we are proud to be part of the City's rebuilding efforts,\" said Rafael E. Cestero, President and CEO, The Community Preservation Corporation. \"The Storm Recovery Loan Fund makes it easier for multifamily building owners to access the capital needed to restore buildings to adequate living conditions and make them more sustainable for years to come.

CPC's portion of the loan will have a rate of approximately 4.5 percent, and HPD's funds have an interest rate of 1 percent, for a blended rate below other conventional financing.", "tag-13": "All projects must comply with HPD standard specifications and substantial rehab projects must achieve Enterprise Green Communities Certification. In keeping with NYC's Greener Greater Buildings Plan, all of the properties financed under this program will be benchmarked for energy usage and retrofit for energy savings will be included in their scopes of work. All buildings burning number 6 oil will be converted to comply with the City's Clean Heat initiative. In addition, gut rehabilitation projects must meet HPD's construction specifications and design guidelines.", "tag-14": "Building owners who are interested in applying for the program should go to NYC.gov or call 311.", "tag-15": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
