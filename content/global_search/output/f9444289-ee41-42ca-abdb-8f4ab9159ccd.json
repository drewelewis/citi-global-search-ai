We are delighted to be assisting small enterprises in Wanzhou, and we believe this project's capacity-building nature and its community-driven approach will bring sustained benefits for the program participants.\"", "tag-5": "Training will initially be conducted by external agricultural experts to the farming instructors selected from 17 villages in Wanzhou. These instructors will then act as trainers for approximately 1,200 rural household enterprises, amounting to around 4,500 residents who are low-income, lack access to capital, agricultural techniques and management skills. The second-phase training sessions will be organized on a monthly basis at 17 farmers' clubs established by the participating villages. It is expected that through their newly acquired skills, farmers will be able to increase their income through professionalizing and scaling up agricultural production and animal husbandry that have proven most profitable under local conditions, introducing new farming methods and products, increasing community engagement and ownership, as well as promoting the need for a sustainable environment.", "tag-6": "Mr. Michael Hermann, Country Representative for FAIHPP China, said: \"China has 128 million rural poor, and poverty alleviation faces great challenges as more than 200 million rural younger laborers have left the harsh agricultural conditions in mountainous areas as migrant workers. Left-behind elders, women and children struggle to improve their livelihood and development perspectives. This program pilots community-driven initiatives of smallholder income-generating activities and provides valuable lessons of decentralized poverty alleviation work for the future. We are grateful to Citi, the Wanzhou District government, Baitu and Puzi township government and village volunteers for their enthusiasm, guidance and support to these 17 communities.\"", "tag-7": "The geography of Wanzhou rural area is characterized by high and steep mountains, hills and poor soil, which make farming extremely difficult. Under the initiative, farmers will learn how to improve the scope and quality of agricultural production and animal husbandry, and enhance the production skills and marketing capability that enable them to create needed communal wealth. The monthly training will include theory, field practice and visiting with other farmers. Training will also encompass sustainable agriculture techniques, such as improving soil and product quality through soil and water conservation techniques, decreasing common animal diseases, and developing marketing and sales skills of distributing agricultural and animal products.", "tag-8": "Citi China  Citi first established an office in China on May 15, 1902, in Shanghai.
