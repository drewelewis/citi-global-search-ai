Thereafter, you stick to those portfolio targets, no matter what happens in the markets. This is considered a prudent approach to investing, because you avoid big bets on any one investment and your success doesn't hinge on guessing the markets' short-term direction.", "tag-4": "Yet anybody with a healthy allocation to stocks who followed this strategy would likely have suffered severe losses in recent months--and even more pain during the 2007-2009 market decline. Are you thinking of ditching the buy-and-hold approach? Keep three things in mind.", "tag-5": "First, changing strategy today could be a case of \"fighting the last war.\" Buy-and-hold may be a money-losing strategy over short time periods. But it has been a smart approach over the long haul as financial markets have tended to rise over time. If you abandon the strategy now, you may be changing course at just the wrong moment.", "tag-6": "Second, there's plenty of risk in the alternative approach, which is to move money around depending on which investments you think will perform best. Some folks may be successful with this strategy, at least for a while, but not everybody can be successful. After all, if some investors manage to beat the market, their market-beating gains must come at the expense of other investors who inevitably lag behind.", "tag-7": "Third, the number of unsuccessful investors may be large. The reason: Actively managing a portfolio can involve high trading costs and big tax bills, both of which will hurt returns. By contrast, buy-and-hold can be a relatively low-cost way to invest because you aren't trading a lot and you will likely be relatively slow to realize taxable gains.", "tag-8": "INVESTMENT PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-9": "The information provided is solely for informational purposes.
