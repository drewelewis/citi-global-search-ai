Much of the discussion focused on urbanization and how the population shift to cities is reshaping the economic landscape and defining the future success of many economies. The United Nations recently estimated that the world's population in 2050 will be 9.6 billion people. According to Citi Research, 70% of the world's population will live in urban areas by 2050 - up from 50% in 2010 - meaning nearly 7 billion people will be living in cities. The impact of this population growth and shift to cities on the global economy is enormous. On Friday, I had the opportunity to speak about these issues on a panel titled 'The City as a Global Growth Engine' with Nicole Bricq, the French Minister of Foreign Trade; Ron Huldai, the Mayor of Tel Aviv; and Andrei Sharanov, Moscow's Deputy Mayor for Economic Policy. The conversation was timely because Citi recently commissioned a report from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) that forecasts the future competitiveness of 120 cities in 2025 and explores the factors that drive market competitiveness. The EIU study identified several key determinants of a city's competitiveness, including governance, sustainability and quality of education. Another driver of a city's competitiveness is its ability to invest in needed infrastructure, including the quality of its physical infrastructure, public transport and telecommunications infrastructure. Investment in Infrastructure  The financial demands on cities to prepare for growth and to be competitive in the global economy are staggering. Oxford Economics forecasts that the investment required in infrastructure by 2025 is $2.1 trillion for Beijing, $1.2 trillion for London, nearly $1 trillion for Mexico City and Sao Paulo, and over $2.5 trillion for New York City. Having served in Mayor Michael Bloomberg's administration in New York City, I have seen firsthand that cities need to invest in innovative projects to stay competitive and provide a high quality of life. New York City has embarked upon several multi-billion dollar transportation infrastructure projects, a $6 billion construction project to build a backup tunnel connecting to the upstate water supply, and is positioning the city as a digital and technology capital with Cornell NYC Tech, a $2 billion initiative to build a tech campus on Roosevelt Island in partnership with Israel's Technion. In light of Super Storm Sandy, Mayor Bloomberg also announced an ambitious plan to spend $20 billion to protect the city from natural disasters. It is clear that the most successful cities of the future will be those that make the commitment to invest in infrastructure projects around transportation, education and energy. The implications of urbanization and population growth came through clearly in St. Petersburg. With our unmatched global footprint and expertise helping cities modernize infrastructure and supporting economic development and job creation, Citi is uniquely positioned to help drive this growth as we continue our more than 200 year legacy of enabling progress."}
