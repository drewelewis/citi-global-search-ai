As a part of its goal to create a digital platform for commerce, Citi has now created the capability for clients to digitally access information related to service inquiries through Citi Service Insights on its award-winning client facing portal, CitiDirect BE. Clients are now able to track payment services digitally, with a centralized view of inquiries through a dashboard and digital connectivity, eliminating the need to contact Citi Service via phone, email or SWIFT message.", "tag-6": "Manish Kohli, Global Payments and Receivables Head at Citi, said, \"Citi Service Insights (CSI) is a digital, self-service tool that can be used as a dashboard for raising, managing and closing out inquiries. The integration of gpi Case Resolution represents a significant milestone in our ability to provide clients with digital servicing capabilities and shows how we are working with the industry to create a seamless payments experience with our clients at the center.\"", "tag-7": "Citi has been at the forefront of the SWIFT gpi initiative -- it is one of the first banks to go live with the Case Resolution functionality as well as the first to use the service leveraging the SWIFT gpi APIs.", "tag-8": "Sara Wong, Treasury Vice President at Instinet said: \"The Citi Service Insights solution has been beneficial for Instinet by eliminating the back and forth of email exchanges and email tracking. By having everything centralized on one platform, this solution simplifies and streamlines what was previously a cumbersome process. As a result, our response times are much faster and we've eliminated the need to maintain contact lists of all Citi teams and branches. Citi Service Insights has delivered a superior experience for us.\"", "tag-9": "Citi Service Insights is globally consistent so no matter where a client's accounts are domiciled or what currencies they are transacting in, they can raise and track cases for these accounts. CSI is also channel-agnostic; all cases with Citi will be visible, regardless of whether they were opened via MT199, email, phone etc. It has also been integrated with SWIFT gpi Case Resolution, creating a more seamless post-payment processing experience, leveraging the latest industry innovations and standards. Early data on the effectiveness of Case Resolution has been very promising, showing that inquiries are resolved faster and more efficiently than equivalent non-Case Resolution inquiries.Over the next few months, this capability will be extended even further to allow clients to directly raise or update gpi Case Resolution queries through Citi Service Insights, giving them a direct pathway to quickly and efficiently resolve payments inquiries. Currently, clients can view the status of Case Resolution inquiries on CSI including the inquiry tracking across the SWIFT gpi tracker. Automated opening of Case Resolution queries is expected soon as well.", "tag-10": "David Scola, Chief Executive of the Americas and UK at SWIFT said: \"Frictionless, secure and instant account to account payments are at the heart of SWIFT's new strategy and so making exceptions and investigations easier to manage is vital for us. On the rare occasion that a payment is held up by an error, gpi Case Resolution enables financial institutions to investigate the issue and fix it efficiently, reducing friction and payments processing times, and improving overall customer experience. We look forward to continuing working closely with Citi as it extends its gpi Case Resolution offering to the benefit of its customers in the coming year.\"", "tag-11": "Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) helps enable our clients' success by providing an integrated suite of innovative and tailored cash management and trade finance services to multinational corporations, financial institutions and public sector organizations across the globe.
