The Food Bank currently serves over 88,000 people per month and, after the renovation, plans to expand its services to more than double this volume. It serves a significantly distressed community with a poverty rate of over 43 percent and unemployment of just under 15 percent. Other projects of the Southwest Community Development Initiative will include charter schools, health clinics and community facilities.", "tag-5": "\"At Citi, our goal is to develop innovative solutions to improve the lives of low- to moderate-income families and to revitalize disinvested communities,\" said Pamela Flaherty, President and CEO of the Citi Foundation. \"By funding the Southwest Community Development Initiative, Citi is increasing the capacity of RDF to bolster the local economies of communities and cities along the border.\"", "tag-6": "\"Citi has been a significant and committed partner of RDF and the Latino community,\" said Tommy Espinoza, President and CEO of RDF. \"We are proud to partner with them on another innovative community-building initiative that will help support low-income communities. Nonprofit organizations are the anchors of our Latino communities. This new program will be critical to helping organizations, such as The Food Bank of the Rio Grande Valley, increase their capacity and become an even greater force in stabilizing and strengthening the communities that they serve.\" Click here to view a video of Tommy Espinoza discussing the Southwest Community Development Initiative.", "tag-7": "As a support corporation of the National Council of La Raza (NCLR), RDF is the largest Latino Community Development Financial Institution (CDFI) in the U.S., with total assets in excess of $100 million.
