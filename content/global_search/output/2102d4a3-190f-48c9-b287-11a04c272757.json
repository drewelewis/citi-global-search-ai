As part of this arrangement the United States took over the work on the Panama Canal, which had begun in the 1880s. On August 17, 1904, at the U.S. government's request, IBC opened a branch in Panama City, followed two years later by one in Col\u00f3n, on the Atlantic side of the young country. IBC provided financing for Panamanian development and banking services for firms working on canal-related business. By 1916, the Panama Canal was in uninterrupted operation and international shipping provided a new client base for financial institutions."}
