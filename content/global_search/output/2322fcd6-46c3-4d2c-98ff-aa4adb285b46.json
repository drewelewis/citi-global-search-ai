(\"Citigroup\") announced today the expiration and final tender results of the previously announced cash tender offers (each, an \"Offer\" and, collectively, the \"Offers\") by Citigroup and its wholly-owned subsidiary Associates First Capital Corporation (\"Associates\") with respect to each series of notes listed in the tables below (the \"Notes\").", "tag-3": "These Offers reflect Citigroup's continued robust liquidity position and are consistent with its recent liability management initiatives. Year-to-date, Citigroup has decreased its outstanding long-term debt by approximately $11.9 billion through these initiatives, including the previously announced redemptions of trust preferred securities and assuming the completion of these Offers. Coupled with the ongoing natural maturing of long-term debt that requires no refinancing, these initiatives result in lower borrowing costs and reduce the overall level of Citigroup's long-term debt outstanding. Citigroup will continue to consider opportunities to repurchase its long-term as well as short-term debt based on several factors, including without limitation the economic value, potential impact on Citigroup's net interest margin and borrowing costs and the overall remaining tenor of its debt portfolio.", "tag-4": "View full release with table in pdf format", "tag-5": "The Expiration Date (September 14, 2012) for Notes validly tendered pursuant to the Offers has now passed.
