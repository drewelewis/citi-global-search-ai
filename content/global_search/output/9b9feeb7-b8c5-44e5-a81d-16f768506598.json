Thus, as the credit environment progresses more favorably, so should the decision-making to generate returns.", "tag-5": "Capital investment intentions also augur well for 2011 and support the cost-of-capital thesis. A study of more than 700 nonfinancial companies covered by Citi equity research analysts show a better than 11% gain in capital expenditures this year, a near doubling from the less than 6% increase in 2010, providing evidence that the changes in capital costs have meaningful impact.
