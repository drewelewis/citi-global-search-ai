(\"Citigroup\") announced today the expiration and final tender results of the previously announced cash tender offers (each, an \"Offer\" and, collectively, the \"Offers\") by Citigroup with respect to each series of notes listed in the tables below (the \"Notes\").", "tag-3": "Notes tendered and accepted pursuant to these Offers, totaling approximately $1.0 billion, reflect Citigroup's continued robust liquidity position and are consistent with its recent liability management initiatives. Year-to-date, and excluding these Offers, Citigroup has decreased its outstanding long-term debt by approximately $13.9 billion through liability management initiatives, including the previously announced redemptions of trust preferred securities. Coupled with the ongoing natural maturing of long-term debt that requires no refinancing, these initiatives result in lower borrowing costs and reduce the overall level of Citigroup's long-term debt outstanding. Citigroup will continue to consider opportunities to repurchase its long-term as well as short-term debt based on several factors, including without limitation the economic value, potential impact on Citigroup's net interest margin and borrowing costs and the overall remaining tenor of its debt portfolio.", "tag-4": "View the full release with tables.", "tag-5": "The Expiration Date (December 21, 2012) for Notes validly tendered pursuant to the Offers has now passed.
