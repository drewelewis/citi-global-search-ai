Theoretical and Empirical Research.'", "tag-1": "Poland: Citi Presents the 2012 Bank Handlowy Award", "tag-2": "Warsaw, Poland \u2013 The 2012 Bank Handlowy Award was awarded to Michal Brzoza-Brzezina, Ph.D., professor at the Warsaw School of Economics and Director of the Bureau of Applied Research of the National Bank of Poland, for his publication, 'Polish Monetary Policy. Theoretical and Empirical Research.'", "tag-3": "Supported by Citi Handlowy's Kronenberg Foundation, the Bank Handlowy Award is granted for special contributions to scientific development in the area of economics and finance and is considered one of the most prestigious distinctions in the Polish economic community. Now in its 18th year, the competition aims to acknowledge the most valuable publications in economics and finance, as well as outstanding Polish economists.", "tag-4": "The winner of this year's Bank Handlowy Award represents the young generation of Polish economists. Michal Brzoza-Brzezina presented a wide review of research methods and topics connected with conducting Polish monetary policy in his book 'Polish Monetary Policy. Theoretical and Empirical Research.' His is the first publication in Poland to present the practical aspects of scientific research on the monetary policy at the Central Bank.", "tag-5": "The author focuses on the factors which have been of the utmost importance to Polish monetary policy decision makers over the last decade. Among other things, he answers questions on how to effectively put an end to the disinflation process, whether inflation that is too low may be harmful to the Polish economy and whether the National Bank of Poland should publish the path of future interest rates. The author discusses if Poland's entering the Eurozone may have negative consequences and how to avoid them.", "tag-6": "The publication suggests that the probability of a total break-up of the Eurozone is rather unlikely. Therefore, it is to be expected that Poland will enter the monetary union in future. In the event of the accession of a country poorer than the Community and having a lower income per capita, there is a risk of unstable boom resulting in recession. The economic break-down may be observed in Eurozone countries such as Portugal, Greece or Ireland. However, there are some tools, namely appropriate monetary policies such as the revaluation of FX rate, which help soothe the effects of Poland entering the monetary union by reducing the GDP volatility and raising the household welfare.", "tag-7": "The judging panel commended the publication's focus on presenting good practices in the area of monetary policy whilst simultaneously following the highest standards of empirical research in a scientific publication and creative revision of theories and hypotheses. The publication focuses on the two most essential aspects of the Polish monetary policy, and, above all, it contains practical and feasible solutions for minimizing the risks connected with Poland's entering the Eurozone.", "tag-8": "The Bank Handlowy Award presents winners with a PLN 50,000 prize grant. Previous winners include among others, Prof. Stanislaw Gomulka, Prof. Witold Kozinski, Prof. Witold Orlowski, and last year's winner, Stanislaw Kubielas, Ph.D.", "tag-9": "Applications for next year's 19th edition of the Bank Handlowy Award can be filed by economic schools and institutes, banks, local commercial chamber institutions and economic publishing houses seated in Poland.
