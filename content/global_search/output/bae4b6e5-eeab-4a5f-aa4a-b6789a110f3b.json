The program is modelled after Citi's own leadership and high-potential development programs, and is designed to give university students the guidance and networking opportunities they need to start their career planning.", "tag-4": "The program attracted over 400 applications from National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University and Singapore Management University. Of these, some 140 university students across all year groups and faculties were selected for the program based on five factors: high academic and leadership achievements, community involvement, internship experiences, interest in the financial industry and potential as future leaders.", "tag-5": "Based on their business interests, these students were matched one-on-one with Citi's experienced staff, who participated in this initiative on a voluntary basis, have at least five years of working experience and hold leadership roles at Citi. The 123 mentors came from 16 business and support functions across Citi's franchise, including Audit, Business Analytics, Compliance, Corporate Affairs, Corporate Banking, Commercial Banking, Credit Payment Products, Finance, Global Markets, Human Resources, Operations, Private Banking, Retail Banking, Risk Management, Technology and Transaction Services.", "tag-6": "Mr. Michael Zink, Head of ASEAN and Citi Country Officer for Singapore, said, \"As the largest banking employer in Singapore with nearly 10,000 employees across the country, we have a part to play in nurturing tomorrow's workforce, which is why I strongly encourage our employees to invest their time in this fulfilling process. By taking an active role in grooming young achievers to take on an increasingly competitive world, positive outcomes are achieved for these individuals and the community at large.\"", "tag-7": "Ms. Moira Lynam, Managing Director and Head of Human Resources for Citi Singapore, said: \"Mentoring future talent is an important part of Citi's business as we recognize that success is driven by people. Through the mentoring relationships, both mentors and mentees benefit from the opportunity to learn from each other. Citi professionals share their business perspectives to guide students through their career planning, while students share fresh viewpoints and challenge professionals to reflect upon their interactions with the workforce of tomorrow.\"", "tag-8": "In January, these student mentees attended the Citi Student Mentorship Program orientation at Citi Singapore's Asia Square premises. At the event, students learned how to build and optimize the value of mentoring relationships, and practiced their networking skills at the \"Meet Your Mentor\" networking session.", "tag-9": "Like Citi's own internal mentorship programs, the Citi Student Mentorship Program includes program-specific trainings for Citi mentors, one-on-one and group mentoring experiences, networking sessions for mentees, briefing sessions for student mentees on how to make the most of the mentoring relationship, and formal evaluations from both sides of the mentorship at the culmination of the program.", "tag-10": "The program runs from January through May to coincide with the academic semester.", "tag-11": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
