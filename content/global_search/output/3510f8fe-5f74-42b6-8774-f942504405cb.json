The IRS estimates that four out of five eligible people claim and receive the EITC, and last year eligible filers received $62 billion in EITC refunds. However, many people, including millions of eligible workers who qualified for the EITC for the first time in 2012, don't know about the EITC or that they must file an income tax return in order to claim the benefit. Every year, 20 percent of eligible taxpayers still do not file for the EITC, leaving billions of dollars unclaimed.", "tag-6": "About the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program The VITA Program generally offers free tax help to people who make $51,000 or less and need assistance in preparing their own tax returns. IRS-certified volunteers provide free basic income tax return preparation with electronic filing to qualified individuals in local communities, and can inform taxpayers about special tax credits for which they may qualify, including the EITC. VITA sites are generally located at community and neighborhood centers, libraries, schools, shopping malls, and other convenient locations.", "tag-7": "Citi developed Money Matters to help connect eligible taxpayers with local community organizations that provide or promote free tax assistance.

This year, I signed a new historic law to double the tax relief available for working families in Illinois by doubling the EITC over the next two years.\"", "tag-11": "Jonathan Mintz, Commissioner, New York City Department of Consumer Affairs: \"Thanks to our certified volunteers at our network of free VITA sites, tens of thousands of New Yorkers were able to avoid high fees and secure millions of dollars in EITC returns during the 2012 tax season. To get that refund, which could amount to as much as $7,900, we're making it easier than ever.\"", "tag-12": "California State Senate President Pro Temp Darrell Steinberg: \"Tax forms can be daunting and overwhelming.
