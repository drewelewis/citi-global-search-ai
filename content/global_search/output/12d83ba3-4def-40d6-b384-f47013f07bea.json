While earnings momentum in EMs is indeed slowing, we continue to see few signs of broad earnings downgrades that would put longer-term earnings projections under pressure. Indeed, the story remains one of strong earnings recovery from the recent trough associated with the recession of 2008-9.", "tag-1": "Emerging market earnings: Holding up well.", "tag-2": "One background concern of emerging market (EM) investors in the first half of 2011 has been that the combination of sluggish economic growth in the developed world and higher inflation in EM countries would lead to significant earnings downgrades and so invalidate the \"attractive valuation\" story for EM equities.

Indeed, the story remains one of strong earnings recovery from the recent trough associated with the recession of 2008-9.", "tag-3": "Corporate earnings in EMs during the downturn fell by just over 40% from their prior peak, a more resilient performance than the 57% drop in EPS in global markets as a whole. Earnings fell the most in Asia (by 50%), with more modest declines in EMEA (by over 45%) and Latin America (by 30%). However, the recovery has been sufficiently strong since the various troughs around the end of 2009, that earnings for EMs as a whole (although not quite yet for overall global markets) have rebounded above their previous high by around 12%, while earnings in each individual region have also hit new highs.", "tag-4": "So the worry is now not over the scale of the earnings rebound, but whether forward momentum is now slowing and whether actual downgrades are becoming significant. Consensus EPS growth in EM is forecast to slow to 18.2% in 2011 and 12.8% in 2012 from 38% last year, an inevitable fading in 12-month momentum as the prospective estimates roll from a high growth year to a lower growth year.", "tag-5": "In our view, concerns over a more severe slowdown in earnings forecasts are overdone. GDP growth forecasts for the emerging markets remain both strong (at over 6%) and resilient. Even as developed market (DM) growth forecasts have been under pressure, there have few growth downgrades to individual EM countries. Pessimism over growth, which in China is at over 9% and in India at around 8%, seems overdone. EPS growth is also likely to be supported by a low cost of capital, with the clearest risk to earnings being a margin squeeze from inflationary pressures with EMs via strong wage growth and rising commodity prices.", "tag-6": "As noted above, current consensus EPS growth for EMs as a whole for 2011 stands at 18.2%, which is up from just over 16% at the beginning of this year. Regionally, earnings forecasts are higher than at the start of 2011 in Asia (+16.8%), having fallen slightly in the past two months, and in EMEA (at 22.4%). Only in Latin America is the consensus EPS forecast for this year lower today (at 20.1%) than at end-2010.", "tag-7": "NOTE: This post is adapted from a Global Emerging Markets Strategist EM Quarterly note, \"Clearing the Road Ahead,\" published on July 8, 2011."}
