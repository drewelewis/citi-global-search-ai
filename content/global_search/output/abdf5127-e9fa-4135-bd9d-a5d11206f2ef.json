This important recognition was awarded for a leasing transaction.", "tag-4": "Citibank Peru acted as the lessor and structuring agent of the financial leasing contract, in 2011, valued at a total of up to US$147 million over seven years, on behalf of the mining company Barrick Misquichilca S.A, making it one of the biggest leasing arrangements made in Peru. The objective of this leasing is to expand the Lagunas Norte mining operation, through the construction of processing pools, leaching pads and the purchase of equipment and other associated services.", "tag-5": "The period of operation (seven years) includes a disbursement and availability period of two years, during which time the structures will be built so that the property can subsequently be leased. This type of transaction represented a very important challenge for the company \u2013 raising up to US$147 million plus General Sales Tax (IGV) in a single financial leasing operation.", "tag-6": "Citibank Peru structured a financial leasing contract in which five different projects are included. This successful business enjoys the participation of the Canadian government agency, Export Development Canada (EDC), which is acting as guarantor of 50 percent of the transaction. This backing enabled Citibank Peru to efficiently place the credit risk of the transaction. Besides, the substitution mechanism was applied to the counterparty credit, which when added to the documentary structure enabled the risk diversification of the portfolio and a reduction in the concentration of funds in a single client, as well as an easing of the restrictions placed upon the transaction by legal limits.", "tag-7": "The result has been, without a doubt, the best financial solution for the client, both in terms of price and structure. It should also be pointed out that the assets leased and the installations where the building work is to be carried out will be the property of Citibank Peru as the lessor, who at the same time will hold the surface rights and a mortgage on the land upon which the building work is being undertaken.", "tag-8": "\"This operation has enabled us to obtain funds at a low cost and in a timely manner in order to meet the disbursement needs for the construction of the new leaching pad and other associated projects at the Lagunas Norte mine. The signing of this creative and innovative contract has contributed to the corporate social responsibility profile, by incorporating local financing for the expansion project,\" said the Barrick Peru Leasing Team, which includes Rafael Rossi, Financial Manager and Edward Uribe, Capital Supervisor Senior.", "tag-9": "\"This transaction represents one of the largest financial leasing contracts in the history of this product in Peru and confirms Citi's commitment in Latin America in general and in Peru specifically. We are committed to offering innovative solutions, capitalizing on our global products experience in more than 100 countries and knowledge of the needs of the client in the market in which they operate,\" said Ricardo Hesse, Executive Director of Transactional Services for Citibank Peru.", "tag-10": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
