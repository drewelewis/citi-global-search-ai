How did that impact you and your view of the sport? </strong> <br><br>A: At the 2009 Nationals in Alaska I took a hard fall on the downhill training run and tore my MCL, PCL and had a big bone bruise. I had to take my first toboggan ride of my career, which is not a fun experience, and then I was in a straight leg brace for 8 weeks, non-weight bearing. Sitting on the couch is not something I like to do, and it was difficult being inactive for that long. It also was a huge motivator for me because I knew that I wanted to continue ski racing, and it really gave me appreciation for my love of ski racing and extra drive to keep moving forward. <br><br><strong>Q: You placed a grim 70th in your first Junior Olympic Games and you were dismissed as a mediocre racer. How did convince yourself to keep moving forward? </strong> <br><br>A: When I was younger I got beat pretty badly in most of the races I entered, but one thing that was a good motivator for me was watching their video and then watching my video. In a lot of ways I thought I skied better than they did, I just didn't have the same speed and size, especially at those younger ages of 12 and 13. A lot of guys I was competing against were almost men, so I definitely knew that was a disadvantage, but I also knew by watching myself ski and how comfortable I was on my skis that I'd eventually figure it out. <br><br><strong>Q: Passing on knowledge and expertise is so important that you're fully engaged with the Youth Enrichment Services operation. How does the work inspire you? </strong> <br><br>A: It's really cool being involved with YES, the Youth Enrichment Services. They help inner city kids who normally wouldn't have the opportunity to ski get on the slopes. It's amazing to help give kids the chance to enjoy the mountains, get out and ski, push themselves and learn the independence of how to do a snow sport. <br><br><strong>Q: Ted, you talked about the importance of kids and skiing, could you share with us a story from your childhood that had to do with skiing? </strong> <br><br>A: I grew up in Park City, Utah, so the really the obvious thing to do is to ski. My parents would go to work and drop my brother and me off and we'd go skiing all day, then they'd come and pick us up in the afternoon - the mountains were like our babysitter. It was a great way to fall in love with the sport being on the mountains pushing yourself with your friends. I was also able to go to Tommy Moe ski camps where he coached when I was a kid - he was one of my idols and a big inspiration for me. That's a big reason of why I like to coach young kids at this point in my career. <br><br><a href=\"https://everystep.citi.com/#rico\">Learn more</a> about how you can support Ted and Youth Enrichment Services.", "tag-1": "Q&A with Team Citi Member Ted Ligety: Beating the Odds and Passing on the Passion", "tag-2": "Join us as we profile nine Team Citi athletes on the Citi Blog as part of our Every Step of the Way program.
