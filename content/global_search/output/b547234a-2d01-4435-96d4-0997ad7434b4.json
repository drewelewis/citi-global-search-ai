From Bangkok: Darren Buckley's Citi Experience in Thailand", "tag-2": "Today, Darren Buckley, Citi Country Officer of Thailand is our guide to Bangkok, an international city with ancient roots.", "tag-3": "At the heart of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), Bangkok, Thailand is the economic, political and cultural capital of the Land of Smiles. Its Thai name has been cited as the longest place name in the world and roughly translates into \"City of angels, great city of immortals, magnificent city of the nine gems, seat of the king, city of royal palaces, home of gods incarnate, erected by Visvakarman at Indra's behest\"... now who wouldn't want to visit a place whose name has promised so much since its founding in the 15th century?", "tag-4": "And Thailand is one of the world's top tourist destinations, with more than 22 million visitors in 2012, most of whom spent their time in Bangkok and on Thailand's beautiful beaches in the south. Named the \"World's Best City\" for four consecutive years, it's a truly cosmopolitan city of almost 15 million people living side-by-side among ancient and modern architecture and customs.", "tag-5": "Citi has had a presence here since 1967 and is today the leading foreign bank in Thailand, employing 2,600 people with more than one million clients and 38 branches. The main office occupies a prime location in downtown Bangkok, adjacent to one of the largest road and public transportation intersections in the city. Indeed Citi, like Bangkok, is a leading gateway to Asia.", "tag-6": "Best Time to Visit: The temperature in Bangkok is warm year-round, but its coolest weather is from November to January, offering a great time for a tropical escape if you're shivering from the colder air in the northern hemisphere. However, during the hottest month of the year when temperatures can reach up to 100 degrees Fahrenheit, the Songkran New Year water festival, held from April 13 to April 15, is a great way to keep cool and experience first-hand the Thai sense of fun and \"sanook\" or \"happiness\". Remember to bring your own sense of humor and a very large water gun!", "tag-7": "Best Local Dishes: Thai cuisine is known worldwide and deservedly so as the list of delectable dishes extends far beyond the well-known Phad Thai. Some of the best include pan-fried cashew nut chicken, basil-chili chicken, deep-fried sea bass, beef with bell peppers, papaya salad, panang curry, massaman curry (voted as best dish in the world), and the delicious dessert mango with sticky rice. The quite spicy Thai peppers are common in many of these dishes, so be prepared for a kick.", "tag-8": "Best Day Trips: There is so much to do in this city that you could live here for years and still not experience everything worthwhile. Relax for a while at Lumpini Park and see the amazing plant life or spend the day taking a cooking class to learn how to make your favorite Thai dishes. If you're adventurous, witness the ancient sport of Muay Thai boxing or even train for a day with real fighters.", "tag-9": "To see the ancient past of the city, venture out to the stunning temples of Wat Phra Kaew in the grand palace or visit Wat Arun (temple of the dawn), the temple that inspired King Taksin to relocate Thailand's capital to Bangkok. You can even take a relaxing cruise down the Chao Phraya on a riverboat tour.", "tag-10": "Why I Decided to Work at Citi Thailand: After 8 years in Japan, I wanted to move to an emerging market country to work in an environment with energy and drive for growth. I asked for Thailand because it has strong strategic relationships with both the US and Japan (important for client continuity) and it was working through the challenges of preparing for ASEAN Economic Integration in 2015. I had briefly worked in the country before and knew that our firm here has great people, a terrific franchise, and a lot of potential.", "tag-11": "Why I Enjoy Living in Bangkok: Living anywhere is defined by the people you meet, the culture, the history and the passion for progress. Bangkok is an amazing city that brings together the best of each; incredibly kind and passionate people, proud history, deep culture, impressive architecture and a drive and hunger for growth and modernization that embraces the best of the past. Truly, Bangkok is an inspiring city.", "tag-12": "And if that's not enough to tempt you to stay, its restaurants, entertainment, sporting facilities and location - close to some of the world's most beautiful beaches and tropical countryside - while also being a gateway to Asia and the world with one of the world's top three international airports, Bangkok is the heart and soul of Amazing Thailand!"}
