The \u20ac1 billion 3-year fixed rate note is funding renewable energy, energy efficiency, sustainable transportation, water quality and conservation, and green building projects, many of which are financed as part of our $100 Billion Environmental Finance Goal. This benchmark bond was followed by the issuance of $143 million equivalent across 18 structured green bond private placements.", "tag-4": "These green bond issuances were an important milestone for Citi and a signal internally and externally of our commitment to sustainable finance and to global growth and progress.

Sustainalytics provided an assessment and second party opinion on the framework's alignment with the transparency and reporting requirements of the Green Bond Principles.", "tag-6": "Working alongside our clients, we are committed to sustainable finance and contributing to the continued development of this market. Through Citi's Sustainable Progress Strategy, our progress toward achieving our $100 Billion Environmental Finance Goal and Citi's green bond issuance, we are helping to finance a more sustainable, low-carbon global economy.
