All materials developed in partnership with Junior Achievement have been adapted to suit pupils' ages, answering to their specific concerns and are providing basic knowledge through an interesting and interactive set of games. We are confident that those students whose financial awareness we can raise while they are very young will be able to handle their finances in a more responsible and efficient way when they become adults.\"", "tag-5": "The program package includes finance and economics DVD teaching materials that have been prepared by Junior Achievement Hungary based on their print teaching materials developed in the U.S. These materials have been adapted to reflect Hungary's market environment and to meet the interests of Hungarian pupils.
