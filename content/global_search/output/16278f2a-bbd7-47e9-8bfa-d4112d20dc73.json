To launch this new initiative with former Citi Hungary colleagues is an extraordinary milestone for us on this occasion. The idea is to celebrate and appreciate all those people who have helped to make Citi the global financial institution that it is today and has been for two hundred years. The Citi Alumni Network offers our former colleagues the opportunity to rebuild their relationships and forge new ties, exchange knowledge and ideas and continue to benefit from Citi's strengths. I know from personal experience how the common experiences within a strong corporate culture can bring people together through their commitment to a unique company, and we should maintain and strengthen these relationships with all Citi Alumni.\"", "tag-4": "Citibank Hungary's Alumni Ambassador Gabor Kovacs remarked: \"I was Citibank Hungary's first employee when I was hired on November 15, 1985, and I worked for the bank as a senior leader in various positions in Budapest and London until 1991. I then returned to Hungary and started my own business. I am very grateful to Citibank for providing me with the knowledge, approach and connections through which I was able to establish my financial background that led the way to my current philanthropic beliefs. It is a great pleasure for me that the Hungarian Citi Alumni Network is being set up, and I look forward with enthusiasm to becoming an active member of the program.\"", "tag-5": "In addition to being a networking tool for former employees, the website will keep them abreast of the latest happenings in the company.
