As one of the few tournaments in the world operated by a non-profit organization, The Citi Open is a noteworthy example of how a corporation and a charitable group can work together towards the common goal of improving people's lives.", "tag-4": "With that focus in mind, we wanted to create multiple opportunities throughout the Citi Open to celebrate the WTEF while providing opportunities for D.C. youth. A new event, \"Citi Open Professional Development Day,\" paired WTEF students with professionals working behind the scenes at the tournament, allowing the students to get a close-up inside look at the various roles involved in making an event like the Citi Open come to life.", "tag-5": "We also brought back the popular \"Speed Serve\" program, in which fans and pro tennis players teamed up to hit serves that resulted in a $50,000 donation for the WTEF at the end of the tournament. Citi also continued a tradition now in its fifth year, the WTEF Hall of Fame, which recognizes individuals who have positively impacted the organization throughout its history. At a special ceremony at this year's Open, we honored three more long-time supporters of the WTEF, bringing the five-year total of honorees to 17.", "tag-6": "Throughout the tournament, the talents of some of the most extraordinary tennis players in the world were on full display. Collectively, the international fields represented 34 countries worldwide, including an impressive 130 ATP/WTA singles titles. For a fifth straight year The Citi Open brought together Citi's mission of enabling growth and progress and the WTEF's mission of building life champions, resulting in a perfect match for tennis fans and the Greater Washington D.C. community alike."}
