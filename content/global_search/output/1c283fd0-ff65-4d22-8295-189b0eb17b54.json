More than just looking at the mere data, I personally feel that MOTY really adds a face and a story to the impact of microfinance, stories that can really inspire a nation to be proactive about ending poverty. MOTY puts the focus on what should really matter most \u2013 the grassroots entrepreneur who used microfinance to help them improve their lives and their communities.\"", "tag-15": "Masikap awardee Imelda Brutas registered annual sales of native delicacies of P3.4 million while providing employment to 23 individuals when she won in 2005.
