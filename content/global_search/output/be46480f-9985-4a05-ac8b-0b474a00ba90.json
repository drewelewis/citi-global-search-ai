Every year my parents, my brother and I spent our summers on the white sandy beaches of the Rockaways, a narrow sand bar of an island between the bay and the ocean within eyesight of Manhattan. For generations we had joined its residents to enjoy all the peninsula had to offer and my husband and I continued to pass these traditions and love for the Rockaways on to our children. From the Parks Department concessions on the board walk to the Public Libraries in Far Rockaway and Rockaway Park, shopping in Bell Harbor to dining at the restaurants in Breezy Point; the Rockaways were not just a summer oasis but a significant member of our family.", "tag-1": "Reflections on Hurricane Sandy from one of the Rockaways' Own", "tag-2": "My earliest good fortune was to have been raised by parents who instilled in me the importance of family, community and the simple pleasure of having \"sand in my shoes\" - a sentiment treasured by all those who live in the Rockaway communities.

The powerful flood water surge washed away, damaged and destroyed residential and business properties and with it--in so many cases, including my own--some of our most precious memories. I realized while sifting through the damage of our home and checking in on family and friends who had been affected that the storm had severely impacted the future of the community's residents, small business owners and aspiring entrepreneurs. I had to put aside my overwhelming sadness, utilize the resources at my disposal and act quickly to help rebuild.", "tag-4": "I work for an organization that recognizes the importance of communities, their residents and the small businesses that are the foundation of thriving neighborhoods. Encouraged by senior management and in partnership with my colleagues in Community Development, we developed a targeted plan focused on recovery for the homeowner. Three days after the storm hit, Citi's immediate response - a $1 million dollar donation in emergency funds to the Red Cross to aid in their relief efforts, was quickly followed by an additional $500,000 to support five community based organizations that could execute on the ground and deliver immediate recovery assistance to in the hardest hit areas across New York City, Long Island and New Jersey. While my family will not directly benefit from Citi's critical response, many in the communities impacted--especially homeowners and small businesses--have been.", "tag-5": "Shortly after, on a cold November day, I visited the distressed Far Rockaway site where one of these five organizations, Margert Community Corporation, was set up in a trailer, actively providing outreach and support services to the neighborhood. Their skilled and experienced staff assisted residents in filling out insurance forms, getting power restored and flood damage assessed. Even though we were in the beginning stages of recovery, my sadness turned to hope as I watched them help rebuild the spirits of those I've considered my neighbors since the first summer I spent with my parents and brother in this community.", "tag-6": "Disaster recovery is a community development responsibility and Citi has been at the forefront of these efforts. In December, Mayor Bloomberg, Community Preservation Corporation and Citi launched a $40 million dollar recovery loan fund for multi-family residential buildings in New York which will provide low-cost loans to restore multi-family buildings and put many NYC residents back into a home. Last week, we announced a collaboration with Citi's longtime partner, the New York City Department of Small Business Services, to support a $1 million dollar grant fund for local businesses that sustained physical damage from the storm. Grants of up to $5,000 will be given to impacted business owners for physical repairs or to replace equipment. Our participation in these funds reinforces Citi's commitment to making sure those affected by Hurricane Sandy have the recovery resources and capital they need to succeed.", "tag-7": "As I rebuild my home in Breezy Point, I am personally grateful to Citi, its leadership and to everyone involved in the customer and mortgage assistance programs and employee volunteer activities to help rebuild all the communities affected by Sandy. My hope is that as the seasons change, many New Yorkers and Citi employees will visit the Rockaway community to support its recovery and experience the pleasure of having \"sand in their shoes.\""}
