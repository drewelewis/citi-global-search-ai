Even though it may seem like there's not enough time in the day, there are lots of ways that volunteering can fit into your life.

We recently hosted a series of <a href=\"https://www.taprootfoundation.org/about-probono/blog/start-small-think-big-citi-scales-skills-marathon-model-pilot-global-initiative\">skills-based volunteer marathons</a> where volunteers were paired with nonprofit organizations to tackle a specific time sensitive organizational need in a one-day setting. This capacity building effort enabled organizations to improve their performance and better serve their clients. But even non skills-based volunteer activities have a tremendous impact. Last year on GCD, a large number of Citi volunteers helped put together comfort kits for the American Red Cross to use in emergencies. One group stuffed teddy bears for children. It wasn't a technically challenging task, but because of their work, the volunteers helped many children in dire circumstances feel comforted and secure. <br><br><strong>Why you should try it.</strong> Volunteering is a way to make a difference while also enhancing your personal and professional skills.
