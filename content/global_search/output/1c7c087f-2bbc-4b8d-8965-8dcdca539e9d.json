It helps to ensure young people can find jobs, be engaged in their communities, and become productive members of society. Sixty-five low and middle income countries lose approximately $92 billion annually by failing to educate girls to the same standard as boys. <a href=\"https://www.empowerweb.org/\"> EMpower</a>-The Emerging Markets Foundation- was founded with the mission to help such youth achieve their educational potential. We work exclusively in Emerging Market (EM) countries, partnering with locally-led organizations that share our mission of empowering at-risk young people between the ages of 10-24. Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, we support relevant education strategies that address specific needs in different countries and communities, and are based on best practices in youth development. <br><br>Education is the largest of EMpower's four investment portfolios. We make strategic contributions in EM countries experiencing a huge bulge in the population of young people (nearly 1 billion youth in the 14 countries where we work), and widening inequalities in education, health, income and opportunity. Through these investments, we work with local grantee partners to grow, develop and, most importantly, transform, the lives of youth in their communities. And we have staying power: we are willing to fund organizations that demonstrate results for up to 10 years, an industry best practice. <br><br>Two nations where we've seen our commitments have measureable impact are South Africa and India. In South Africa, where the apartheid legacy has not erased yawning gaps and the quality of math and science education is substandard (South Africa ranked 137 out of 139 countries), EMpower is investing in 'second chance' programs that level the playing field. After-school and Saturday tutoring programs and math and science intensives for girls are just a few of the initiatives we've help put in place. Education-focused grantees include Ikamva Youth, Future of the African Daughter, Equal Education, Wilderness Foundation, Etafeni Trust. <br><br>In India, education is compulsory and free through grade 8.

We are investing in programs to keep girls in school through covering fees and uniforms, conducting outreach to mitigate parents' concerns about their daughters' safety and marriageability, and ensuring a high quality of education so it is seen as value-add not an opportunity cost.
