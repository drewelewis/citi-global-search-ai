It's as simple as that. There are so many underprivileged people. Whether it be financially, socially, physically... the reason is irrelevant. I feel blessed in my life with what I have. I feel that the least that I can do is to help others as much as possible so they feel blessed and live a life they always wanted to have. <br><strong><br>\u2022 What advice would you give to someone who wanted to start volunteering in their community? </strong> <br><br>Find something you are passionate about, whether it be children, families, people with disabilities, community clean-up, etc. There is no wrong answer. There are few things in life that give you immediate gratification. I've yet to volunteer and walk away without a smile and knowing I made a difference. <br><br><strong>\u2022 In what ways do you think volunteering makes a difference? </strong> <br><br>Knowing that you've touched someone else's life makes a big difference. It can be small or big. Every time you volunteer, someone will notice. Helping build a house through Habitat for Humanity makes a person that much closer to having a home and you can say without doubt you helped make that happen. <br><br>Interested in volunteering for Habitat for Humanity?
