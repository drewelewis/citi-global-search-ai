Since then, Citibank has distinguished itself in the credit card securitization market by its innovativeness. Citibank was the first bank credit card ABS issuer to apply many now-familiar and standard structural features: bullet principal repayment, credit enhancement via Class B subordinated securities, single-seller commercial paper (CP) program, non-USD denominated securities issuance, and de-linked subordinated securities.", "tag-3": "Citibank has consistently applied securitization to fund a portion of its credit card portfolio. The securitization market has been reliable across market cycles, and has provided liquidity out to 30 years. Currently, securitization funds approximately 10% of Citibank's U.S. credit card business. The proportion of funding raised through securitization may vary due to changes in business strategy."}
