Citi was represented by a strong delegation of colleagues from across the company who were able to engage in a candid dialogue and advance relationships with key stakeholders. Our shared conversations provoked both thought and action around ways to address the complex challenges facing U.S. cities -- and given Citi's focus on urbanization as a driver of global economic trends, our team had a lot to contribute to the dialogue.", "tag-1": "U.S. Conference of Mayors - Helping Cities Drive Solutions to Urban Challenges", "tag-2": "Last week I had the privilege of joining nearly 300 mayors and city leaders, in Washington, D.C. at the 82nd U.S. Conference of Mayors Winter Meeting.

Throughout the event, as mayors shared \"Innovation Moments\" that highlighted local successes, it was especially encouraging that so many of them were based on partnerships with private sector stakeholders -- including Citi and many of our institutional clients.", "tag-4": "Citi's business is to help cities adapt, grow, and thrive by developing services that meet the needs of communities, business owners, and municipal administrators. We're proud of this work and we remain focused on collaborating with public sector and nonprofit partners to enable urban progress in ways that leverage our expertise and experience. We remain committed to leveraging our networks and resources to address many of the toughest challenges faced by urban leaders, particularly when it comes to growing our economy. More than a year ago, Citi Community Development, supported the launch of a growing initiative to address long-term unemployment, an issue that continues to be a central part of the national conversation about job growth. Similarly, we're also working to seed an urban manufacturing movement that is creating meaningful employment in cities across the country.", "tag-5": "Citi is proud to help fuel big ideas conceived by big thinkers -- leaders we like to call Progress Makers. By giving them platforms to share and scale their innovations, we're supporting our clients, colleagues and community partners as they bring to life ideas for creating cities that are more sustainable, more efficient and more livable.", "tag-6": "We look forward to our continuing engagement with the U.S. Conference of Mayors, and to meeting again this summer at the organization's annual meeting in Dallas.", "tag-7": "To learn more about how Citi works to fuel urban progress, visit Citi for Cities."}
