Some may even stare because they have a friend or family member experiencing something similar, and are uncertain how to approach a conversation, or how to help. It's okay to be curious, awe-struck or even to stare, but it's important you also engage and ask questions. A conversation can lead to further understanding and stronger allyship. The conversations may not always be easy, but they're crucial as we work to build a more inclusive world.", "tag-4": "That's why we're proud to announce that, together with our 15 new Team Citi winter Para athletes, we're continuing our #StareAtGreatness campaign to help change perceptions of people with disabilities.", "tag-5": "Our Team Citi winter Para athletes are among the most talented in the world and are examples of the excellence we work towards every day as a firm.
