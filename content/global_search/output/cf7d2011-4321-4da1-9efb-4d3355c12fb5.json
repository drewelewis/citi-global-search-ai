Year-to-date, and excluding the Offers, Citigroup has decreased its outstanding long-term debt by approximately $13.9 billion through liability management initiatives, including the previously announced redemptions of trust preferred securities. Coupled with the ongoing natural maturing of long-term debt that requires no refinancing, these initiatives result in lower borrowing costs and reduce the overall level of Citigroup's long-term debt outstanding. Citigroup will continue to consider opportunities to repurchase its long-term as well as short-term debt based on several factors, including without limitation the economic value, potential impact on Citigroup's net interest margin and borrowing costs and the overall remaining tenor of its debt portfolio.", "tag-4": "The Fixed Spread Offers are being made pursuant to the offer to purchase dated November 21, 2012 (the \"Offer to Purchase,\" as may be amended or supplemented from time to time), and the related letter of transmittal (the \"Letter of Transmittal,\" as may be amended or supplemented from time to time) which set forth in more detail the terms and conditions of the Fixed Spread Offers.
