This morning, we reported results for the fourth quarter--and full year--of 2013. I'd like to take a few moments to go through them with you.", "tag-3": "Citi's profit for the quarter was $2.7 billion, or $0.85 per diluted share. Excluding credit and debt valuation adjustments, and also a benefit from the sale of the Brazilian credit card issuer Credicard, earnings were $2.6 billion, or $0.82 per diluted share, on revenues of $17.9 billion.", "tag-4": "For the full year 2013, Citi earned $13.8 billion on revenues of $76.7 billion, again adjusting for CVA/DVA and other disclosed items. 2013 was not only Citi's fourth full year of profitability since the financial crisis--it was also Citi's most profitable year since 2006. I'll start by going through the performance in each of our operating businesses in the fourth quarter. Our Markets businesses were negatively impacted by the government shutdown in October and by continued uncertainty about the timing of the Federal Reserve tapering its quantitative easing program. Securities & Banking revenues of $4.6 billion declined 5% from last year and 9% from the prior quarter. The latter decline reflected lower markets revenues, particularly in fixed income which was partially offset by gains in investment banking. For the full year, while fixed income revenues were down, both equities and investment banking showed improvement. Overall, our S&B franchise continued to show momentum with revenues up 4% and expenses down 3%, resulting in 16% growth in pre-tax earnings. In Transaction Services, revenues in the fourth quarter were up slightly from last year in constant dollars as strong fee income growth more than offset a decline in net interest revenues. Despite the ongoing impact of interest rate spread compression, our volume drivers again remained positive with increases in trade loan originations, average deposits, assets under custody and settlement volumes. Turning to Consumer Banking, revenues in North America were down 8% year-over-year while up 3% sequentially. The decline from the fourth quarter last year is largely a result of the slowdown in U.S. mortgage refinancing activity as well as the continuing effect of the low interest rate environment on our deposit business, partially offset by loan and deposit growth. Overall in 2013, the North America business executed well in the face of several changes, including the re-sizing of our mortgage business, the continued revitalization of Branded Cards and the successful acquisition of the Best Buy portfolio by our Retail Services, or private label credit cards, business. In International Consumer Banking, revenues grew 2% year-over-year in the fourth quarter in constant dollars while expenses increased by 3%, driven by repositioning charges in the fourth quarter of 2013. While revenues in the quarter continued to reflect spread compression as well as the impact of regulatory changes and the repositioning of our franchise in Korea, most key drivers remained positive with both average loans and card purchase sales up 6% from last year. We also made progress on several key priorities throughout the year. We improved efficiency by increasing revenues while reducing expenses. We utilized $2.4 billion of our deferred tax assets. We further reduced Citi Holdings assets by 25%. Holdings' net loss in the fourth quarter was roughly $400 million and for the full year, Holdings' losses declined by nearly half. As we have previously stated, we will continue to wind down Holdings assets in an economically rational manner although we do expect legal and related costs to remain elevated. Finally, Citi's capital and liquidity positions remained strong in the fourth quarter, with estimated liquidity resources in excess of $400 billion and an estimated Basel III Tier 1 Common ratio of 10.5%. Citigroup's supplementary leverage ratio increased to an estimated 5.4% for the fourth quarter. While we faced challenges in the fourth quarter, on a full year basis for 2013, our franchise performed well--particularly in the first half--despite an uneven macro environment. Looking ahead to 2014, we will remain focused on continuing to improve our operational efficiency and maintaining credit discipline while delivering for our clients.", "tag-5": "To get more in-depth information on today's earnings report, visit the Investor Relations section of Citigroup's website.", "tag-6": "Thank you once again for your interest in Citi, and I look forward to reviewing our first quarter results with you in April."}
