At some point, this tragic situation will subside, but the challenge that climate change poses to our planet will still be with us.", "tag-4": "Today, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, our commitment to fighting the \"climate emergency\" remains a top priority for us at Citi.", "tag-5": "Since it first launched as a social-action-based movement in the U.S. in 1970, Earth Day has evolved into a global call to action. Fittingly, this year's theme is \"climate action,\" a phrase that articulates a clear response to the \"climate emergency.\" The urgent need to take action, and go beyond promises and rhetoric, resonates with many of us as we acknowledge the need to do more \u2013 more to rebalance the natural world and human society, and more to amplify our efforts to finance climate solutions and reduce climate risk.", "tag-6": "As we look to the future, we are proud of what we accomplished in the past year. In 2019, we concluded the Sustainable Progress Strategy that we launched in 2015.

That reality is reflected in much of the work we've accomplished, but we realize there is more to do. To continue supporting a more sustainable world and the transition to a low-carbon economy, we need to increase our focus on improving resilience, reducing climate risk, building sustainable infrastructure, and developing innovative, transition financing. All of these themes remain central to Citi's sustainability strategy going forward.", "tag-9": "On the horizon, Citi is planning to deepen and broaden our efforts to confront climate change. Those efforts and activities include an expanded focus on engaging our clients, investors, fellow colleagues and advocacy groups, and developing stronger partnerships with our peers to take on this challenge together. We will also continue to build a more reliable toolbox for climate risk assessment that will enable our businesses to more accurately measure, understand and manage our climate change impacts and opportunities. We will continue to disclose and analyze those results, which remain central to our success and our ability to drive creative and collaborative solutions.", "tag-10": "We also recognize that crisis fatigue may become part of the \"new normal\" as the world gradually moves past the current crisis. As an organization firmly committed to long-termism and forward thinking, we see the clear parallels between the virus and climate change that can't be ignored \u2013 including how the cost and disruption of managing the crisis will only increase the longer we delay. As we move forward at Citi, we will continue to challenge ourselves to answer the question: what did we learn from our response to this crisis that we can \u2013 and will \u2013 apply to the longer-term climate challenge?", "tag-11": "We encourage you to do the same."}
