While the $2.09 billion spent by hedge funds is equivalent to just 2.8 percent of forecasted total industry-wide securities and investment spending of $75 billion, hedge fund IT investments have a disproportionately large impact on advancing the capabilities of the overall financial services industry due to their complex trading strategies and multi-asset focus.\"", "tag-5": "As the survey demonstrates, hedge funds are changing their approach to investing in new information technologies. While hedge funds have traditionally sought to differentiate themselves and to enhance their own performance through technological innovation, the current risk and regulatory environment is driving hedge funds to invest instead in more efficient use of collateral and financing. Software and solutions designed to improve portfolio management and trading have become standardized and disseminated across a broad group of hedge funds.", "tag-6": "\"The survey findings have important implications for hedge funds making their own plans for technology and other capital expenditures in 2012,\" said Alan Pace, Head of Citi Prime Finance in the Americas. \"We are committed to delivering this type of thought leadership on a consistent basis as part of our overall business advisory offering, as feedback from clients and other industry players indicates that such studies provide information that individual clients would find impossible to obtain on their own.\"", "tag-7": "Large or \"franchise\" hedge funds \u2013 those managing $5 billion or more \u2013 realize significant economies of scale in their information technology expenditures. Franchise-sized firms with assets under management (AUM) in excess of $5 billion are expected to spend an average of $7.9 million on technology in 2011 \u2013 more than 13 times the amount forecast for small funds with AUM less than $500 million. Small funds charge nearly the entire IT expense to their management company, but as AUM grows, more of these expenses are charged back to the fund level. The largest hedge funds are able to charge 20 to 30 percent of these costs back to the fund.", "tag-8": "\"The allocation of more expenses to the fund, rather than to the management company, can be considered a premium that investors pay to access these managers and reflects the ability of the largest funds to absorb these expenses without significantly affecting performance,\" said Bill Saltus, Head of Hedge Fund Technology Consulting, at Citi Prime Finance. \"The hedge fund business is highly competitive and, as our survey also indicates, innovations in technology are making it easier for newcomers to enter the field.\"", "tag-9": "Other survey findings include:", "tag-10": "\"The survey results indicate that there are multiple vendors and outsourced service providers offering solutions for core functions such as portfolio management and trading,\" said Bill Saltus, Head of Hedge Fund Technology Consulting at Citi Prime Finance. \"Leading funds and specialized consultants are now offering risk, finance and collateral management solutions while developing unified data management platforms and other platforms to give hedge funds the flexibility they will need to address evolving demands from regulators and investors.\"", "tag-11": "The full report can be viewed at: http://www.citigroup.com/transactionservices/home/demo/tutorials26 /fb_CitiPrimeFinanceITSurvey_Sep2011/", "tag-12": "First Derivatives  First Derivatives is a global provider of software and consulting services to the financial services industry.
