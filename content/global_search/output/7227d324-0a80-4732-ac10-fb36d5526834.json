The answer may run counter to your intuition.", "tag-4": "People are often inclined to buy stocks and stock funds in their retirement accounts, because these are seen as longer-term investments, while favoring bonds and other interest-paying investments in their taxable accounts. And that may indeed be the right strategy for some folks. Still, you might consider the benefits of doing just the opposite.", "tag-5": "If you hold stocks and stock funds in a retirement account, your eventual withdrawals might be taxed at federal income-tax rates of as much as 35%, based on 2012's tax law. But if you purchase your stock-market investments in a regular taxable account, your qualifying dividends and realized capital gains on investments held more than a year are taxable in 2012 at a maximum federal rate of just 15%. Moreover, in the case of capital gains, you may be able to defer the tax bill simply by hanging on to your winning investments for longer.", "tag-6": "By contrast, if you hold your bonds and other interest-paying investments in a taxable account, you can get hit with big annual tax bills. Each year's interest is taxed as ordinary income, which can mean paying that federal rate of as much as 35%. By stashing these interest-generating investments in a retirement account, you can defer these tax bills.", "tag-7": "To be sure, you could also avoid the big annual tax bills by using your taxable accounts to buy municipal bonds, which typically generate tax-free interest. But because of that tax savings, the nominal yield on munis is usually less than the nominal yield on comparable taxable bonds. Result? You can potentially boost returns by opting for higher-yielding taxable bonds in your retirement accounts, while favoring stock-market investments in your taxable accounts.", "tag-8": "INVESTMENT PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022 NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-9": "Bonds are affected by a number of risks, including fluctuations in interest rates, credit risk and prepayment risk. In general, as prevailing interest rates rise, fixed income securities prices will fall. Bonds face credit risk if a decline in an issuer's credit rating, or creditworthiness, causes a bond's price to decline. High yield bonds are subject to additional risks such as increased risk of default and greater volatility because of the lower credit quality of the issues. Finally, bonds can be subject to prepayment risk. When interest rates fall, an issuer may choose to borrow money at a lower interest rate, while paying off its previously issued bonds. As a consequence, underlying bonds will lose the interest payments from the investment and will be forced to reinvest in a market where prevailing interest rates are lower than when the initial investment was made.", "tag-10": "Depending on your state of residency, some bonds may be exempt from state and local taxes; however, interest may be subject to the federal Alternative Minimum Tax.", "tag-11": "Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates do not provide tax or legal advice.
