New York State introduced anti-discrimination legislation. It allowed anyone with a grievance to take a complaint to a commission that would make representations to the corporation concerned, with a view to an informal solution. The bank's top management recognized the importance of the new law.", "tag-6": "Cuyler took his responsibilities seriously. On one occasion there was a shortage of stenographers in his department, and an African-American woman presented herself as a candidate. When her potential co-workers were consulted by their immediate boss about this possible appointment, they expressed reservations. Cuyler decided to talk to them himself, explaining the new law. \"The two girls took the day off,\" Cuyler recalled, \"and much to my delight, the day following they came in and told me, really enthusiastically, they would welcome this girl in the department, and would do everything possible to make her happy there.\" The applicant was offered the job. \"She came in, was employed, and it worked out very well.\" Cuyler viewed the organization's approaches to such issues as very enlightened. \"I think they do show the bank's general attitude towards personnel and problems we had, and some of the things we wanted to accomplish.\"", "tag-7": "By the 1950s the bank was beginning to employ a growing number of female officers. The recruitment of graduates, already established practice for several decades for men, was being extended to women and African Americans. Even in the mid-1960s, however, women were rarely employed in the bank's service overseas, and were not often seen in the officers' dining room at the bank's new headquarters at 399 Park Avenue. Walter Wriston is credited with fixing the dining problem, although it took longer for the bank to get comfortable with the idea of sending women abroad.", "tag-8": "The bank was active, however, in bringing local overseas officers to New York, starting in the early 1950s. Among the first was Tatsuo Umezono, later the first Japanese to be put in charge of the branches in Japan. Over the next decade, foreign officers brought to New York for training included a young Chinese-Singaporean banker named Wong Nang Jang, later the first Singaporean to be put in charge of the Singapore operation.", "tag-9": "When the bank's 11 Cuban branches were nationalized in 1960, many of the 100 local employees who left for the United States were employed in New York (others were hired by the bank in Puerto Rico and Ecuador).", "tag-10": "As Walter Wriston put it in typically direct terms after his retirement, \"We hired brains and we didn't care what color you were. Talent has no borders.\" For Wriston, hiring outstanding people was the top priority. \"All organizational structures are designed to be run by average people,\" he said. \"If this were not so, all organizations would break down because most of us are average. If you have outstanding people, as we do, any organization will run at 150 percent of rate capacity."}
