We increased our net income to $11.3 billion, up 6% from the previous year, and reached key benchmarks in our consumer businesses, showing our strategy is achieving results. Clearly, the macro environment has impacted the capital markets and we will continue to right-size our businesses to match the environment. With Citi Holdings assets at 12% after the transfer of retail partner cards to Citicorp, we are increasingly focused on driving earnings through our core franchise and beginning to return capital to our shareholders this year.\"", "tag-6": "The majority of the revenue decline in 2011 was driven by the ongoing reduction in Citi Holdings assets, which declined approximately $90 billion during the year to $269 billion. Citi Holdings 2011 revenues declined 33%, or $6.4 billion, to $12.9 billion. Citicorp revenues for 2011 were $64.6 billion, down 2%, or $1.0 billion, from 2010 as revenue growth in Regional Consumer Banking (RCB) and Transaction Services was offset by declines in Securities and Banking revenues.", "tag-7": "Fourth quarter revenues included $(40) million for credit valuation adjustment (CVA) and debt valuation adjustment (DVA), as credit spreads tightened during the quarter3. CVA/DVA in the third quarter 2011 was $1.9 billion and in the fourth quarter 2010 was $(1.1) billion. Full year CVA/DVA in 2011 was $1.8 billion compared to $(469) million in 2010. Excluding CVA/DVA, Citigroup fourth quarter 2011 revenues were $17.2 billion, down 12% as compared to the prior year period, and full year 2011 revenues were $76.5 billion, also a 12% decline from full year 2010.", "tag-8": "Citicorp revenues of $14.0 billion in the fourth quarter 2011 included $(74) million of CVA/DVA compared to $(1.0) billion in the prior year period. Excluding CVA/DVA, Citicorp revenues of $14.1 billion were 8% below the fourth quarter 2010. The decline was largely due to lower revenues in Securities and Banking, which, excluding CVA/DVA, were 29% below the prior year period and more than offset a 1% growth in RCB revenues and 2% growth in Transaction Services revenues from the prior year period.", "tag-9": "Citi Holdings revenues of $2.8 billion in the fourth quarter 2011 were 30% below the prior year period. The decline in Citi Holdings revenues was principally due to the continuing reduction in assets, which decreased $90 billion, or 25%, from the end of 2010. Citi Holdings assets of $269 billion at the end of the fourth quarter 2011 included approximately $45 billion related to Citi's retail partner cards business which, as previously announced, Citi intends to transfer into Citicorp during the first quarter 2012. Citi Holdings assets at the end of the fourth quarter represented approximately 14% of total Citigroup assets, and less than 12% of Citi's total assets after reflecting the transfer of Citi retail partner cards.", "tag-10": "Citigroup's net income declined 11% from the fourth quarter 2010 to $1.2 billion in the fourth quarter 2011, reflecting a $1.2 billion decline in year-over-year revenues, a $465 million increase in operating expenses and a $470 million increase in the provision for taxes, which offset a $2.0 billion improvement in the cost of credit from the prior year period. Compared to the prior year, total cost of credit in the fourth quarter fell 41% to $2.9 billion. The improvement in credit costs was driven by a 40% decline in net credit losses to $4.1 billion partially offset by a smaller release of credit reserves of $1.5 billion. The credit reserve release reflects a lower level of inherent losses remaining in the portfolio. Operating expenses increased 4% from the prior year period to $12.9 billion. Fourth quarter 2011 expenses included $557 million of legal and related costs and the previously announced repositioning charge of $428 million. Additionally, as previously announced, the $470 million increase in the provision for taxes includes a tax charge of $300 million due to a write-down in the value of Japanese deferred tax assets reflecting legislation in Japan that decreased the corporate income tax rate. Citigroup's effective tax rate for the full year 2011 was 24.1%.", "tag-11": "Citigroup's total allowance for loan losses was $30.1 billion at quarter end, or 4.7% of total loans. The $1.5 billion net release of credit reserves in the quarter was down 35% from the prior year period. Credit reserve releases in Citicorp of $699 million were $42 million lower than the prior year period as additional credit reserve releases in North America RCB, largely related to Citi-branded cards, were offset by credit reserve builds in international RCB (Asia, Latin America and EMEA). Citi Holdings credit reserve releases fell $743 million to $767 million as releases in Local Consumer Lending (LCL) decreased, largely due to lower releases in the retail partner cards portfolio and lower releases in the Special Asset Pool (SAP) where total loan levels and charge-offs declined. Citigroup asset quality continued to improve as total non-accrual assets fell 44% to $11.8 billion from fourth quarter 2010. Corporate non-accrual loans fell 62% to $3.2 billion and consumer non-accrual loans fell 26% to $8.0 billion.

The decrease was primarily driven by an 11% decline in net income in Transaction Services to $776 million, and a loss in Securities and Banking of $163 million in the fourth quarter 2011, which were partially offset by an 8% increase in net income in RCB to $1.4 billion.", "tag-16": "Citicorp cost of credit in the fourth quarter 2011 fell 37% from the prior year period to $1.2 billion. The decline was largely driven by a $759 million decline in net credit losses to $1.9 billion that was partially offset by a $42 million decrease in the release of credit reserves to $699 million. The substantial majority of the reserve release was attributed to consumer loans, largely Citi-branded cards, as credit quality across the consumer portfolio continued to improve. Citicorp's consumer loans 90+ days delinquent fell 22% from the prior year period to $2.4 billion, and the 90+ days delinquent ratio fell 27% to 0.98% of loans.", "tag-17": "Citicorp operating expenses increased 8% year-over-year to $10.2 billion, largely driven by ongoing investments, repositioning charges and legal and related expenses, offset by expense savings initiatives.", "tag-18": "Citicorp end of period loans grew 14% versus the prior year period to $465 billion, with most of the growth coming from Latin America and Asia.

Revenue growth of 2% in international RCB was offset by a 2% decline in North America RCB. International RCB revenues grew 6% versus the prior year period ex-FX. Conversely, net income in international RCB declined 16% from the prior year period to $788 million, while North America RCB net income increased 64% to $661 million, largely as a result of credit reserve builds internationally and higher credit reserve releases and lower net credit losses in North America.", "tag-20": "North America RCB revenues declined 2% versus the prior year period to $3.5 billion. The decline reflected lower revenues in Citi-branded cards, due to a 3% decline in average loans coupled with continued pressure on net interest margin and lower fees in banking that were partially offset by improved results in mortgages.", "tag-21": "North America RCB net income was $661 million, up 64% from the fourth quarter 2010. The growth in net income was driven by a $333 million increase in credit reserve releases and a $718 million decrease in net credit losses versus the prior year period. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter grew 31% from the prior year period to $2.1 billion largely due to ongoing investment spending in marketing and technology and an increase in litigation reserves in cards.", "tag-22": "North America RCB credit quality continued to improve as net credit losses fell $718 million, or 41%, to $1.0 billion compared to the prior year period. Net credit losses improved in both Citi-branded cards and retail banking. Delinquency rates in both cards and retail banking also improved across virtually all buckets versus the prior year period. The total net credit reserve release in the fourth quarter was $681 million, $333 million higher than the net credit reserve release in the fourth quarter 2010, largely driven by Citi-branded cards.", "tag-23": "International RCB revenues grew 2% to $4.7 billion versus the fourth quarter 2010. Revenue growth in Latin America (3%, 9% ex-FX) and in Asia (5%, 5% ex-FX), more than offset a 12% (7% ex-FX) decline in EMEA revenues. Latin America and Asia saw year-over-year growth in average loans, average deposits and purchase sales.", "tag-24": "International RCB net income fell 16% from the prior year period to $788 million due to a net credit reserve build of $72 million in the fourth quarter 2011 compared to a net release of $203 million in the prior year period, and the impact of the Japan DTA write-down. Operating expenses in the fourth quarter 2011 were essentially unchanged from the prior year period. Absent repositioning, and legal and related charges taken in the fourth quarter 2011, international RCB expenses declined. As a result, overall international RCB produced positive operating leverage in the quarter, reflecting positive operating leverage in both Asia RCB and Latin America RCB.", "tag-25": "International RCB credit quality improved from the prior year period as net credit losses fell 10% to $683 million. Credit reserves were built by $72 million in the fourth quarter 2011, compared to a release of $203 million in the prior year period, as Asia, Latin America and EMEA all recorded reserve builds, largely reflecting ongoing growth in loan portfolios. Overall credit quality in international RCB continued to improve as delinquency rates in both Citi-branded cards and retail banking were lower across all delinquency buckets even as the underlying loan portfolios continued to grow.", "tag-26": "Securities and Banking Securities and Banking revenues declined 10% from the prior year period to $3.2 billion. While the fourth quarter 2011 had $(74) million of CVA/DVA, the prior year period had CVA/DVA of $(1.0) billion.

The fourth quarter reflected ongoing market fears of the European sovereign debt crisis and its potential impact on other markets and the global economy. Those concerns led to broad de-risking by clients and declines in client activity as well as market volumes around the world. Citi also continued to maintain a conservative risk profile during the quarter, while remaining focused on serving the needs of its clients. The decline in Fixed Income revenues from the prior year period largely reflected significantly lower results in credit products and securitized products that were partially offset by revenue growth in rates and currencies, especially in local emerging markets.", "tag-28": "Equity Markets revenues of $240 million in the fourth quarter 2011 included $8 million of CVA/DVA. Excluding CVA/DVA, equity revenues fell 71% year-over-year to $232 million. Equity market volumes declined in the fourth quarter as clients broadly reduced activity levels in the face of market uncertainty. The difficult market conditions in the fourth quarter drove significant declines in derivatives revenues and, to a lesser degree, declines in revenues in cash equities.", "tag-29": "Investment Banking revenues declined 45% from the prior year period to $638 million as revenues in advisory, debt underwriting and equity underwriting all fell. The decline in revenues was driven by lower volumes in mergers and acquisitions and equity issuance and continued low volumes in bond underwriting globally, reflecting the continued difficult and uncertain market conditions.", "tag-30": "Lending revenues declined 15% from the prior year period to $164 million, due primarily to a loss on hedges as credit spreads narrowed during the quarter.", "tag-31": "Securities and Banking produced a loss of $163 million in the fourth quarter reflecting lower revenues and higher expenses, particularly repositioning charges taken in the fourth quarter.", "tag-32": "Transaction Services  Transaction Services revenues were $2.6 billion, up 2% from the prior year period, driven largely by 7% year-over-year growth in Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS), which was partially offset by a 10% decline in revenues in Securities and Fund Services (SFS). TTS revenue growth reflected strong growth in average assets, while the decline in SFS revenues reflected lower volumes, reduced spreads and the impact of FX.", "tag-33": "Transaction Services net income of $776 million fell 11% from the fourth quarter 2010, reflecting continued spread compression and a 14% increase in operating expenses to $1.5 billion primarily due to investment spending, severance, and legal and related charges.", "tag-34": "Transaction Services average deposits and other customer liabilities balances grew 4% year-over-year to $368 billion, and assets under custody fell 1% to $12.5 trillion. The decline in assets under custody was largely related to the impact of foreign exchange.", "tag-35": "Citi Holdings  Citi Holdings revenues decreased 30% from the prior year period to $2.8 billion as assets declined 25% to $269 billion. Lower revenues in LCL and negative revenues in SAP drove the lower results in Citi Holdings. LCL revenues of $3.0 billion fell 13% from the prior year period primarily due to the 21% decline in average loans to $183 billion. SAP revenues fell $660 million from the prior year period to $(234) million, primarily due to lower net interest revenue. The decline in net interest revenue reflects the decrease in interest earning assets as total assets declined 49% year-over-year to $41 billion. Brokerage and Asset Management revenues were $43 million, compared to $136 million in the prior year period, largely reflecting a decline in the equity contribution from the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture.", "tag-36": "Citi Holdings net loss of $806 million decreased 21% from the prior year period.

Credit improved in LCL with net credit losses declining 38% from the prior year period to $2.2 billion, partially offset by a 32% decrease in the credit reserve release to $530 million. Improvement in net credit losses was reflected across international, North America retail partner cards and North America real estate lending portfolios in LCL. Year-over-year cost of credit in SAP also improved as a $593 million reduction in net credit losses was partially offset by a $487 million, or 67%, reduction in the loan loss reserve release.
