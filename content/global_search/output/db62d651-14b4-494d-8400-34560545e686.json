Financial education is a joint effort between parents, schools and the banking industry. Citi is proud to be part of a program that helps give kids a healthy financial start.\"", "tag-7": "Teach Children to Save is the banking industry's largest collaborative effort to encourage youth savings.

Thirty-eight percent admitted to bringing up the subject of money with children only as \"the need arises.\" Respondents also said they wished their parents taught them about saving for the future (27 percent) and investing for the future (24 percent).", "tag-9": "Of the lessons they want to instill in their own children, 57 percent of respondents said that saving for the future was the most important, followed by household budgeting at 44 percent. Other key lessons of the financial facts of life included managing debt (28 percent) and understanding their credit histories and credit scores (21 percent).", "tag-10": "\"Findings like these make it clear that while many parents understand the importance of financial education, there is a reticence to talk plainly and frequently with their children about the critical money management skills that will benefit them throughout their lives,\" said Bob Annibale, Citi Global Director of Community Development. \"Together with our consumer banking colleagues and with the leadership of the ABA, Citi Community Development is pleased to participate in Teach Children to Save, which reinforces our year-round support for initiatives that link financial access with the necessary financial education so that the next generation can realize their goals.\"", "tag-11": "\"It's inspiring to see bankers across the country build this foundation for a positive financial future,\" said Frank Keating, ABA president and CEO. \"Citi's many hours of dedicated service to the Teach Children to Save mission have significantly advanced financial literacy directly in the communities it serves.\"", "tag-12": "This year, nearly 10,000 bankers from banks of all sizes are participating in 49 states, Guam, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia.
