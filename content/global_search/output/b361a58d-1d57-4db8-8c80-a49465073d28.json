However, creating and maintaining a budget are a first step toward understanding your finances, as well as getting spending under control. This is especially important if you have a family, but singles can also benefit greatly from abiding by a budget. Nowhere is this more true than in a large city.", "tag-3": "In a large urban metropolis, such as New York, London or Tokyo, living on a budget can seem next to impossible. High cost of living, higher taxes and limitless options for how to spend your money on any given day can be huge deterrents towards budget creation. However, with a little financial savvy and determination, it can be done.", "tag-4": "Below are 5 tips to help you on the path towards creating a sustainable budget, while also enjoying big city life:", "tag-5": "1) Pick a More Affordable City", "tag-6": "You may dream of New York, London or Paris, but be sure to do your research on the cost of living in these cities. There are many other big cities that can offer the culture and vitality of these places, but for less money. Panama City, Bucharest and Chicago, Illinois are just a few cities that provide the amenities of their rivals for a fraction of the cost. If you are moving for a new job, see if your employer has the ability to place you in a city that is more affordable.", "tag-7": "2) Keep Track of Your Day-to-Day", "tag-8": "Just like staying in good health is a daily effort, so is maintaining a budget. One of the daily habits to get into is writing down your day to day costs. Although you can trim a little from your grocery bill or daily commuting costs, you may want to focus more energy on discretionary spending. The extra pair of high end shoes, weekly expensive restaurant outings, vacations and even daily coffee can be scaled back to produce more savings. And let's face it, many people would say that overindulging in these habits is a vice, anyway!", "tag-9": "However, this does not mean you give up these pleasures all together. A simple solution is to rank which of these items give you the most pleasure and reduce consumption of the ones that are at the bottom of the list.", "tag-10": "If you still can't seem to stay on track, take this piece of advice from Jonathan Clements, our resident Personal Finance expert: \"For one month, write down every expense you incur. This won't just tell you where your dollars go. It will also make you think harder before you crack open your wallet-and you may find yourself being more careful with your spending.\"", "tag-11": "3) Fixed Cost Focus", "tag-12": "Just as important as day-to-day spending is keeping on top of your fixed expenses. Your biggest fixed monthly expense is likely your mortgage or rent. Lenders have become increasingly stringent with borrowers and don't like to see homebuyers taking on mortgage payments that exceed a certain level of pre-tax income. If you are a homeowner with big mortgage payments, you may want to look into refinancing to lock in a lower rate. If you're paying more than you can afford, you may want to look into sharing costs with a roommate, downsizing or moving into a more affordable neighborhood.", "tag-13": "Smaller steps, such as selecting a less expensive cable and internet package, or reducing your usage of household utilities, can also have a positive impact on your savings.", "tag-14": "4) You Don't Need A Car", "tag-15": "Most cities are very walkable and provide efficient public transportation. In fact, having a car in a city can end up being more of a headache than a help-parking is usually a nightmare, careless street parking (not necessarily on your behalf) can result in unwanted scratches to your car and driving in city traffic is a huge stress catalyst.", "tag-16": "If you're going through extreme vehicle withdrawal, you can always alleviate it by using car sharing services or a rental car for short shopping or day trips on the open road.", "tag-17": "5) Get the City Experience, the Smart Way", "tag-18": "One of the primary reasons people move to cities is to enjoy all the culture, events and nightlife they have to offer. You should absolutely take advantage of these offerings, otherwise your city experience will be incomplete. However, do a little research before walking out your door. Public programs, such as outdoor concerts, donation only or pay-what-you'd like weekends at museums, street fairs and online deal sites with specials such as Living Social and Groupon, provide a more affordable experience.", "tag-19": "Don't skimp on the experience, just get the most for your money!", "tag-20": "If you are one of those people who is saving enough money every month and is building a nice retirement nest, then you may not need to follow the above guidelines. However, if you are barely making ends meet then try to incorporate these steps into your daily routine. Creating a budget in a large city can be a daunting task, but through a little ingenuity and discipline on your part, it will help pay dividends in planning for your future."}
