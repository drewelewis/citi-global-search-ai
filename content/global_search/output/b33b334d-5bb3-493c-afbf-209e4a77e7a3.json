So often, entrepreneurial callings are personal - they are scratching their own itch. One of the founders of ReadImagine, Phat Phuong, is the youngest of nine children, came to the US as a refugee, and spent a lot of time hanging out in public libraries.

Heather Hiles wanted to start an education company to help every person find greater clarity of purpose.", "tag-5": "NBC", "tag-6": "To watch the Innovation Challenge as it progresses, check out www.educationnation.com or follow on twitter at @citi, @nsvf, and @educationnation (hashtag #innovationchallenge)."}
