At our events, homeowners have the chance to look at each option and figure out which one applies to them.", "tag-4": "Over 200 homeowners received counsel at our Riverside event on Tuesday - a record turn-out for the Road to Recovery Tour. According to The Press Enterprise, one attendee said she almost didn't come out to the event because of pictures she'd seen in the media of homeowners at similar events standing in line for hours in the sun. Thankfully, she was pleasantly surprised by the experience we provided saying, \"I've got a bathroom, I've got a place to sit and I've got air-conditioning.\"", "tag-5": "Details about time and place for future events can be found at www.citiroadtorecovery.com.
