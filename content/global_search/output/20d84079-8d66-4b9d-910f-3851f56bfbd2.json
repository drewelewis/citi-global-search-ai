Citi continues to hold a drive each year to collect wireless devices employees no longer use. Devices are shipped to the recycler, appraised, and a portion of their value is then donated to charities selected by Citi. The drive is an important element of Citi's Sustainable Technology program, a commitment to responsible asset management through recycling and our desire for active involvement in the communities where we work and live.", "tag-4": "Our US employees and Asset Management Team collected more than 7,000 devices, which were data-scrubbed and then recycled or disposed of under a zero-landfill policy. This proved to be a successful partnership with e-Cycle as we raised $63,175 which we then donated to three reputable charities; $25,000 to Wounded Warrior Project\u00ae; $25,000 to The Hunger Project and $13,175 to The Floating Hospital. The work done by these organizations is humbling and we are honored to support their missions.", "tag-5": "Here are the Environmental Impact results from this campaign:", "tag-6": "- prevented contamination of 282,680,000 gallons of water;", "tag-7": "- prevented the release of 4.52 pounds of lead into environment;", "tag-8": "- reduced greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to taking 0.20 cars off the road for a year;", "tag-9": "- saved enough energy to power a laptop for 310,948 hours and provide 1.28 households with electricity for an entire year.", "tag-10": "Now in its seventh year, Citi's \"Wireless Drop-Off\" is one of the ways we are working to promote environmental sustainability and social responsibility. To date, we have recycled more than 22,000 mobile devices through this program and donated $139,175 to various charitable organizations. The success of this program is due to the continued participation of the metro/regional site coordinators and employees. I look forward to next year; number eight being just as great!"}
