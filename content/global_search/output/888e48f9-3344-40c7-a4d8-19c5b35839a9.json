What if you find errors on one or more of your reports? First, don't delay. You might call the credit bureaus involved or you may be able to fill out a form on their website. If you call, make notes of your conversation and get the name and extension of the person you talked to, in case you need to follow up later.", "tag-4": "Many people, however, prefer to write a letter. If you go that route, be sure to include copies--not originals--of any documents that support your position. In addition to your name, address and phone number, clearly state which items on the report are wrong. You may want to include a copy of the report and circle the items in question. The letter should be sent by overnight mail, return receipt requested.", "tag-5": "The credit bureau must investigate your claim within 30 days and forward all relevant information to the company that supplied the inaccuracy. If the investigation results in a change in your report, the credit bureau is required to give you the results in writing, as well as a free copy of your credit report.", "tag-6": "Keep in mind that creditors make mistakes, too. If the erroneous information on your credit reports came from a creditor--such as your credit-card company, bank, utility or a retailer--call that company first and ask the company to inform the credit bureaus.
