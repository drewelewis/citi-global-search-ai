Does that mean you should go for an ARM, as adjustable-rate mortgages are often called? Like many things in life, it depends.", "tag-3": "On the other hand, suppose you have a secure job with a steady paycheck and you feel you can handle the risk that your monthly payment could rise sharply. In that scenario, you might consider some type of ARM. An ARM may also make sense for folks who believe their incomes will rise in the years ahead or who expect to move or refinance fairly quickly. The reason: An ARM will often charge a lower interest rate initially. But these mortgages also come with added risk. After an initial term, which might be just one year or it could be five years, the interest rate on an ARM will reset periodically to keep the rate in line with current market interest rates. ARMs typically have both a periodic rate cap and a lifetime cap, thus limiting the amount the interest rate can increase each adjustment period and over the life of the loan, though larger increases may be allowed at the first adjustment. Given the possibility that mortgage rates could rise from today's historically low levels, you might calculate what your ARM payments would be if rates go up--and then weigh whether you could handle the higher payments.", "tag-4": "The information provided is solely for informational purposes.
