Imagine you had settled on a mix of 60% in U.S. and foreign stocks and 40% in high-quality bonds, certificates of deposit and other conservative investments.", "tag-3": "Even if you haven't done any buying or selling since, there's a good chance you don't have a 60%-40% mix today, thanks to all the market turbulence. Depending on when you first bought your 60%-40% mix, today you may have far less in stocks than you intended--or significantly more.", "tag-4": "To help get your portfolio back on track, consider rebalancing, possibly once a year or after big market moves. Imagine that, because of the recent swoon in share prices, you now have substantially less than 60% of your portfolio's value in stocks. To get your portfolio back to your target portfolio percentages, you would need to add money to the stock side of your portfolio to build it back up to 60%. By adding to your stocks, you'll likely be better positioned if stocks rally.", "tag-5": "But rebalancing isn't principally about boosting performance. Rather, it's about managing risk. By rebalancing, whether it is adding to stocks at a market bottom or lightening up on shares during a bull market, you can help your portfolio stay closer to the risk profile you originally settled on.", "tag-6": "One warning: Rebalancing can mean selling investments with capital gains, so it's best done in a retirement account, where selling won't trigger a tax bill. Even with a retirement account, you should consider the investment costs involved when buying and selling. What if you need to rebalance within a taxable account? To reduce the amount of buying and selling you need to do, you might focus on directing dividends, interest and new savings to those parts of your portfolio that have become underweighted.", "tag-7": "INVESTMENT PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-8": "The information provided is solely for informational purposes.
