Those markets considered 'safe-haven' locations continue to attract private investors looking for both prime residential and commercial property. Political and economic uncertainty across the world is only helping to exacerbate the trend.", "tag-11": "\"But it is not just property where HNWIs from fast-growing economies are making their mark. The Wealth Report's Attitudes Survey reveals that they are playing an increasingly important role in the worlds of sport, fine art, wine, and philanthropy.\"", "tag-12": "Luigi Pigorini, CEO Citi Private Bank Europe, Middle East & Africa comments:", "tag-13": "\"Wealthy individuals and families, especially those originating from Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia, have become extraordinarily global in nature. Many seek the rule of law and stability that make the U.K. a top choice for investment. With English a popular second language and a relatively weak pound, the global wealthy have confidently focused their interest on London and the wealth preservation it can afford.", "tag-14": "\"Investors seeking a more conservative strategy have gravitated toward high-quality properties in central business districts in cities such as Beijing, London, Munich, New York, Paris and Sydney. Conversely, for those willing to accept more risk, high growth markets, such as Asia and Latin America, may be able to generate more attractive returns relative to the US and Europe. Investors must remain cautious as global economic growth will continue to influence all property markets, and investors should measure their yield and return expectations taking growth into account.\"", "tag-15": "Visit The Wealth Report 2012 site at www.thewealthreport.net.", "tag-16": "Notes to Editors The Wealth Report, produced by Knight Frank in conjunction with Citi Private Bank, offers a unique and global perspective on the world of prime property and wealth.
