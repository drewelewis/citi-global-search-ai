Last year, Citi introduced the Citi Military PCS (Permanent Change of Station) Transfer Assistance Program, a reduced payment program for qualifying service members who have PCS orders. Service members required to relocate who have CitiMortgage-owned first mortgages may have their monthly payments reduced to $250.00, or to their escrow payment only, for a six-month period.
