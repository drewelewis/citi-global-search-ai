There are no doubts that the Citibank PayPass Credit Cards will become exceptionally popular.\"", "tag-4": "New credit cards issued for Citi Handlowy Clients after June 1 are all PayPass cards. Equipped with MasterCard\u00ae PayPass\u2122 or Visa payWave technology, the cards will allow customers to make cashless transactions in a few seconds. For purchases of PLN 50.00 or less, customers do not have to input their PIN or verify by signature on a regular swipe machine. All customers have to do is to pass their card near a special reader. The cards are equipped with a special chip so customers do not need to swipe or insert it into a terminal. To ensure maximum security of PayPass payments of greater than PLN 50.00, for MasterCard payments customers will verify the transaction by entering their PIN or providing a signature on the receipt. For VISA transactions, the payments are made in a standard way, by inserting the card into the terminal.", "tag-5": "As with the previous cards of this type, the Citibank MasterCard\u00ae PayPass\u2122 Credit Card and the Citibank Visa payWave Credit Card can be sent to customers by post or issued on location at the bank's branch.

The time needed to provide customers with such a card, including the assignment of a secret PIN, is only 45 minutes.", "tag-6": "As many as 20,000 terminals in Poland accept the PayPass cards, including the most popular brands, such as Empik stores, Ikea, Rossman, McDonald's, Sferis, Matras bookstores and Shell petrol stations.", "tag-7": "The bank will be systematically exchanging the credit cards for the plastic cards equipped with PayPass technology.
