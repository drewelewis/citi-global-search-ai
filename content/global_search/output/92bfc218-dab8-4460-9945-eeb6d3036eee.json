Consider these five steps.", "tag-1": "On borrowed time.", "tag-2": "Worried you have too much debt? Consider these five steps.", "tag-3": "1. Stop the bleeding. The first step is to stop accumulating debt and put yourself on a cash diet. As soon as you get your paycheck, make your required debt payments--and then strive to live on whatever remains.", "tag-4": "2. Set priorities. Figure out which debts you should aim to pay off first. In all likelihood, you will want to rid yourself of your highest-cost debt. That might mean starting with credit-card balances, moving on to car loans and then possibly making additional principal payments on your mortgage.", "tag-5": "3. Consider consolidating. You might provide yourself with some breathing room, and simultaneously simplify your finances, by consolidating your debts.", "tag-6": "This may work best if you own your home and have built up some home equity. Depending on your financial situation, you might borrow against your house through a home-equity loan or line of credit and then use the money to pay off higher-interest debt. As an added bonus, the interest on your home-equity borrowing could be tax-deductible.", "tag-7": "Alternatively, you might pay off other debts by refinancing your home and taking out a larger mortgage. This makes most sense if you can, in the process, also lower your mortgage rate.", "tag-8": "4. Avoid a relapse. Once you have dug yourself out of debt, make sure you don't slip back. The surest method is to use cash for all purchases. Many people, however, favor credit cards, so they can earn cash back, frequent-flier miles and other rewards. If you use credit cards, try deducting your credit-card charges from your check register. That way, you know you will have the money to pay off the credit-card bills when they arrive.", "tag-9": "5. Move forward. The first four steps may stabilize your finances. But what you really want is to start making some progress. One possibility: Turn your debt payments into regular monthly investments.", "tag-10": "Let's say you are paying $350 a month on an auto loan. When the loan is paid off, keep writing that check every month--but consider sending the money to an investment account instead. You are used to living without the $350 every month, so this can be a painless way of stepping up your savings rate. One warning: A regular investment program like this doesn't guarantee you'll make money and you could still suffer an investment loss.", "tag-11": "INVESTMENT PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-12": "The information provided is solely for informational purposes.

Home equity plans typically involve variable interest rates rather than fixed rates. Before entering into a plan, consider how you will pay back any money you might borrow. Some plans set minimum payments that cover a portion of the principal (the amount you borrow) plus accrued interest. But, unlike the typical installment loan, the portion that goes toward principal may not be enough to repay the debt by the end of the term. Many of the costs in setting up a home equity line are similar to those you pay when buying a home, and certain fees may apply.", "tag-16": "Citigroup Inc. policy does not permit clients to use the proceeds of a home loan to invest in the securities or related markets.
