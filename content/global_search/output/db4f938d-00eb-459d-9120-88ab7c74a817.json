According to the Center for Responsible Lending, 12 million people every year are trapped in a cycle of payday loans that are tied to interest rates as high as 400 percent, transferring $5 billion every year from working families to predatory payday lenders.", "tag-5": "\"The Micro Branch is designed to meet the financial service needs of low-income families today and to connect them with actionable education and asset-building products that create economic opportunity and security for the future,\" said Martin Eakes, CEO of Self-Help. \"Through this collaboration with Citi Community Development, we will be able to serve thousands of Californians that would otherwise lose significant portions of their incomes to predatory providers.\"", "tag-6": "The Micro Branch provides critical asset-building opportunities that are not available when people cash their checks at alternative check cashing outlets, including depository services, the chance to develop or repair credit ratings and access to responsibly provided credit. To help clients take advantage of these opportunities, the Micro Branch model makes use of innovative, \"in-line\" financial education, in which \"bite-size\" financial management concepts are delivered at the teller line, when consumers are focused on their financial decision-making.", "tag-7": "\"Check cashing is a critical service for many people, and particularly in these challenging times, every dollar matters,\" said Bob Annibale, Citi's Global Director for Community Development and Microfinance. \"Self-Help's efforts to reach people outside of the economic mainstream and to preserve families' hard earned income are incredibly important. By cashing customers' checks at a reasonable cost, the Micro Branch not only fulfills an important financial need, but also creates an opportunity to move people toward a wider array of products and services that will help them save and build assets over time.\"", "tag-8": "The Micro Branch, which will be supported with a $200,000 contribution from Citi Community Development, seeks to operate at complete self-sufficiency by the end of its third year by growing its customer base and transitioning check cashing customers into active account holders who can take advantage of a suite of responsible banking and lending products. Citi's contribution will be used for enhanced outreach to increase the number of individuals who transition from alternative and predatory financial services providers, and to support staff capacity to refine and deliver \"in line\" financial education. Citi's support also will fund an analysis of the Micro Branch operating model and customer outcomes to explore how Self-Help and other Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) can replicate and scale the program.", "tag-9": "1 Center for Financial Services Innovation, Underbanked Consumer Study, \"Underbanked Consumer Overview & Market Segments\".
