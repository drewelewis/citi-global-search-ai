The two new indices are designed to measure the onshore Chinese fixed income market across government, agency, and corporate sectors. The Interbank index covers a subset of bonds from the Chinese (Onshore CNY) Broad Bond Index that are traded on the China Interbank Bond Market (CIBM). The CIBM market represents the largest trading venue by volume for onshore bonds and has been further opened up to foreign institutional investors since February 2016. The index could serve as a performance benchmark for investors looking to establish their exposure to Chinese onshore bonds through either CIBM direct access or the anticipated Hong Kong-Mainland China Bond Connect program that will also allow access to CIBM bonds.", "tag-4": "Additionally, onshore Chinese bonds are eligible for inclusion into our family of government bond indices. Given that as of the June 2017 index profile, the China market has met the criteria for inclusion for the Citi World Government Bond Index - Extended (WGBI-Extended) for three consecutive months; it will be part of the WGBI-Extended in July 2017.", "tag-5": "\"We are happy to further represent the third largest bond market in the world with the inclusion of onshore Chinese bonds in the WGBI-Extended and the addition of indices that reflect the broader China bond market inclusive of corporate and regional government bonds,\" said Arom Pathammavong, Global Head of Citi Fixed Income Indices.", "tag-6": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
