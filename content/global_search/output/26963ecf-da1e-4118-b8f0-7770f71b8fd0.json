Under President Moses Taylor in the late 1800s, the bank adopted a policy of \"ready money,\" stressing liquidity and investing in call loans as a secondary reserve. It was this conservative policy that made National City Bank one of New York's strongest banks in the second half of the 19th century. The bank's deposits rose in each of the financial panics during this period, while the average deposits of the city's other banks fell.", "tag-5": "The end of the Spanish-American War and the first big transaction  By the end of the 19th century, some of National City Bank's large corporate clients had extensive business outside the United States, and in 1897, the bank opened a Foreign Exchange Department, offering to buy and sell drafts, make cable transfers and collections and issue travelers' letters of credit. One of the first big transactions came in 1899 when the bank received a $5-million deposit from the United States Treasury. This amount was to be credited to Spain as part of a $20-million payment for the Philippines under the treaty ending the Spanish-American War. By this time, National City Bank already had a correspondent banking relationship with Deutsche Bank in Berlin as well as arrangements with the London City and Midland Bank and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank. By 1902, National City Bank had accounts with 132 banks across the world.", "tag-6": "New York head office and the first overseas branch  At the end of the 19th century, the bank's head office occupied an entire city block and was often featured on New York picture postcards. The building, known as 55 Wall Street, stood where the original Merchants' Exchange had been before it was destroyed in the Wall Street fire of December 1835. Before the official opening of the head office on December 21, 1908, a challenging relocation of all books, papers, typewriters and other office material took place with the help of some 400 employees between two lines of police. Over $70 million in cash and $500 million in securities were transferred by hand to the two-story steel vault. The bank had its offices at 55 Wall Street by the 1980s.", "tag-7": "The very first overseas branch of any nationally chartered bank in America was opened two months after the outbreak of World War I, on November 14, 1914, in Buenos Aires. Only one year later the National City Bank started its presence in Asia, after it acquired a controlling interest in the International Banking Corporation (IBC).", "tag-8": "Citi Never Sleeps  By 1965, National City Bank was America's second-largest domestic bank and its top bank overseas with 163 branches and affiliates in 55 countries. By 1902, it was the only bank that could pay out \"any sum of money in any currency in any city in the world within 24 hours.\" The \"Citi Never Sleeps\" slogan dates back to the bank's early deployment of the ATM. In 1974, there were no customer-friendly ATMs. Although Citicorp did not invent the ATM, it was the first to introduce a complete system for New York City. The bank's first ATM was launched at a branch in Queens in 1977. By the end of that year, all the bank's New York branches would have at least two machines operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week. This commitment was the origin of the slogan \"Citi never sleeps.\"", "tag-9": "Citibank in the Czech Republic  In 1990, Citibank established a representative office in Prague and on June 24, 1991, the first clients were welcomed. At that time, the bank began offering commercial banking services to the newly emerging private sector. Consequently, Citibank started also providing a wide range of lending services, including major financing for the Czech national airline, a mobile phone provider and other businesses. In 1997, Central European Magazine rated Citibank the best international bank in the Czech Republic. By 1998, when Citibank's holding company, Citicorp, merged with Travelers Group to form Citigroup, it was the seventh largest bank in the Czech Republic. Citibank has repeatedly won important awards on both the global and local levels for its exquisite services in cash management \u2013 for example \"The Best Global Emerging Markets Investment Bank\" and \"The Best Global Transaction Banking House\" awards by Euromoney magazine (2012) and \"The Best Corporate/Institutional Internet Bank in the Czech Republic\" by Global Finance (2005, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011 and 2012).", "tag-10": "Leader in innovations Citibank continues to invest in new technologies with the aim to increase the comfort and safety of its clients, particularly in the area of digital banking. During 2011, Citibank strengthened its leading position in the area of contactless payments when, as the first bank on the Czech market, launched contactless credit cards. Thanks to the MasterCard PayPass technology, the credit cards allow faster payments for small purchases up to 500 CZK without authorization of a payment with a PIN code.", "tag-11": "In summer 2011, Citibank launched a pilot project for contactless mobile payments in cooperation with Telef\u00f3nica Czech Republic, Komercn\u00ed banka, VISA Europe and Globus CR. The new \"Near-Field Communication\" technology brings payment card functionality to a mobile phone SIM card. In October 2011, Citibank's product portfolio was extended by special contactless stickers. Since fall this year, Citibank's clients can also use Citi Mobile application, the most comprehensive mobile banking solution for smart phones. This application has received the \"Overall Most Innovative 2012 Monarch Innovation Award\", presented by Barlow Research Associates, Inc. In fall 2012, Citibank became the first bank on the Czech market to offer Centralized Household Payment Collection (CHPC) payments and O2 service payments by direct debit from credit cards. A month later, Citibank received the MasterCard award for The First Multifunctional Credit Card with the Transportation solution in the Czech Republic that is being issued in cooperation with Liberec region.", "tag-12": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
