Erin has chosen to support the USA Slider Search program, a national recruitment tour to help identify and instruct young luge athletes. <br><br>We learned what fueled her progress: her go-for-it attitude, hard work, loud cheers and more. <br><br>Q: Did luge come naturally to you or was it something you had to work at to gain success? <br><br>A: I did not naturally stand out in my first years practicing the sport. I had to work pretty hard to achieve the goals that I have set for myself, but also to get to the same standard level as everyone else around me. I was never the fastest, and I was never the best at the start. I was always kind of middle of the pack, but did my thing at a slow and steady pace and just learned everything I could. I think I was like the sleeping giant, I was just there, and then something clicked at some point and I just started going fast. <br><br>Q: You had a tough day before that victory at the World Championship due to migraines. What do you tell yourself and others to overcome an obstacle like that? <br><br>A: I think knowing what you have to do to get through the migraines is important. In those situations you feel like everything is working against you, but you've put in too much work and time to let something take you out of the game. As athletes, we've been in pain in the gym and in a lot of other ways, so when things are against you, it's almost more satisfying to come out on top. <br><br>Q: Your comfort zone is Lake Placid; you must have a lot of fan support there. <br><br>A: I am from a very small rural area in upstate New York and I've pretty much gotten them all to be luge fans, which is amazing. Every time I race in Lake Placid, I definitely get the loudest cheers. My family members have been pretty die hard luge fans, they have rallied through years and years of standing in the cold and traveling. My brothers are pretty famous for being the chest-painted crew at the Olympic Games and other big races and in the past. <br><br>Q: Your dedication to the sport is shown with the USA Luge Slider Search Program. Tell us about it. <br><br>A: Supporting the USA Luge Slider Search and being a part of the process of developing future athletes is something that I am passionate about because it's how I was introduced to the sport. And thinking of the last fourteen years of my life, I'm very thankful that I've been able to do this. I want to be able to share that with other generations and to encourage young athletes and kids to really go out on a limb and say okay that looks fun, I have no idea what it's going to lead to, but I'll try it. <br><br>Go <a href=\"https://everystep.citi.com/#erin\">here</a> to learn more about the USA Luge Slider Search Program and how you can support Erin's team.", "tag-1": "Q&A with Team Citi Member Erin Hamlin: The Journey from 'Sleeping Giant' to Gold Medalist", "tag-2": "Join us as we profile nine Team Citi athletes on the Citi Blog as part of our Every Step of the Way program.
