The study suggests that hedge funds will spend approximately $2.09 billion on IT in 2011.", "tag-3": "The survey, which sought input from more than 75 hedge funds in the U.S. and Europe and 15 vendors, documents for the first time both the industry's aggregate expenditure on information technology and the average expenditure per hedge fund.", "tag-4": "\"The Citi Prime Finance survey demonstrates the powerful impact of technological innovation on the hedge fund industry,\" said Sandy Kaul, US Head of Business Advisory Services of Citi Prime Finance. \"The survey, providing information on IT investment for the first time, enables industry participants to evaluate their own expenditures and see how they stack up against their competitors. While the $2.09 billion spent by hedge funds is equivalent to just 2.8 percent of forecasted total industry-wide securities and investment spending of $75 billion, hedge fund IT investments have a disproportionately large impact on advancing the capabilities of the overall financial services industry due to their complex trading strategies and multi-asset focus.\"", "tag-5": "As the survey demonstrates, hedge funds are changing their approach to investing in new information technologies. While hedge funds have traditionally sought to differentiate themselves and to enhance their own performance through technological innovation, the current risk and regulatory environment is driving hedge funds to invest instead in more efficient use of collateral and financing. Software and solutions designed to improve portfolio management and trading have become standardized and disseminated across a broad group of hedge funds.", "tag-6": "Large or \"franchise\" hedge funds - those managing $5 billion or more - realize significant economies of scale in their information technology expenditures. Franchise-sized firms with assets under management (AUM) in excess of $5 billion are expected to spend an average of $7.9 million on technology in 2011 - more than 13 times the amount forecast for small funds with AUM less than $500 million. Small funds charge nearly the entire IT expense to their management company, but as AUM grows, more of these expenses are charged back to the fund level. The largest hedge funds are able to charge 20 to 30 percent of these costs back to the fund.", "tag-7": "\"The survey results indicate that there are multiple vendors and outsourced service providers offering solutions for core functions such as portfolio management and trading,\" said Bill Saltus, Head of Hedge Fund Technology Consulting at Citi Prime Finance. \"Leading funds and specialized consultants are now offering risk, finance and collateral management solutions while developing unified data management platforms and other platforms to give hedge funds the flexibility they will need to address evolving demands from regulators and investors.\"", "tag-8": "The full report can be viewed here.", "tag-9": "About First Derivatives", "tag-10": "First Derivatives is a global provider of software and consulting services to the financial services industry.
