Citicorp revenues of $16.5 billion were 16% higher sequentially, but 11% lower than the prior year period. The year over year decline was mainly driven by lower revenues in Fixed Income Markets and North America Regional Consumer Banking, as well as negative CVA.", "tag-6": "Credit continued to improve during the quarter, as Citigroup net credit losses declined for the seventh consecutive quarter to $6.3 billion.

This transfer permits the sale of those assets, which have disproportionately higher risk-weightings under Basel III. The transfer resulted in a net $709 million pre-tax charge to revenues, from the recognition of $1.7 billion in pre-tax losses ($1.0 after-tax) which were previously reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI), partially offset by $946 million of mark-to-market and realized gains on those assets.", "tag-9": "Citi continued to improve its capital strength, with a Tier 1 Common ratio of 11.3%, book value per share of $5.85 and tangible book value per share of $4.69, each as of the end of the first quarter 2011.", "tag-10": "\"As America's global bank, we are focused on supporting the real economy and creating opportunities for our clients to succeed.

Net interest revenues also included a $245 million pre-tax charge to increase reserves related to customer refunds in Japan Consumer Finance.

A significant portion of the reduction was due to the recapitalization of Maltby Acquisitions Limited, the holding company that controls EMI Group Ltd., during the first quarter 2011. The allowance for loan losses was 247% of non-accrual loans. Citigroup end of period assets were $1.95 trillion, down 3% year over year. Citigroup end of period deposits were $866 billion, up 5% year over year, driven by a 28% increase in non-interest bearing deposits.

Year over year, Securities and Banking revenues declined 25%, driven principally by lower Fixed Income Markets revenues and a negative CVA of $229 million (compared to positive $285 million in the prior year period). Excluding CVA, Fixed Income Markets revenues fell 22% to $4.0 billion, largely due to declines in rates and currencies, and credit and securitized products. Investment Banking revenues were $851 million, down 19% from the prior year period, primarily reflecting lower revenues from municipal and investment grade debt underwriting.
