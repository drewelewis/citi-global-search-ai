Excluding CVA/DVA, revenues decreased 9% from the prior year period, driven by the continued wind down of Citi Holdings, partially offset by a 6% increase in Citicorp revenues. Net income of $3.6 billion increased 4%, driven by a 25% increase in Citicorp net income. Earnings per share of $1.14 increased 8% from $1.06 per diluted share in the prior year period, driven by the growth in net income and a 5% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding.", "tag-5": "Citi CEO Michael Corbat said, \"We had a strong finish to 2016, bringing momentum into this year. We drove revenue growth in our businesses and demonstrated strong expense discipline across the firm. We achieved a full year Citicorp efficiency ratio of 58% as we had targeted, while again increasing our loans and deposits.", "tag-6": "\"This quarter marks the last time we will report the results of Citi Holdings separately. At its peak, Holdings had over $800 billion in assets, generating sometimes multi-billion dollar losses in a single quarter.

In constant dollars, operating expenses fell 6%, mainly driven by lower expenses in Citi Holdings largely due to divestitures.", "tag-14": "Citigroup's cost of credit in the fourth quarter 2016 was $1.8 billion, a 29% decrease, driven by the absence of significant loan loss reserve builds related to energy exposures in Institutional Clients Group (ICG) as well as lower provision for benefits and claims and a decline in net credit losses.", "tag-15": "Citigroup's allowance for loan losses was $12.1 billion at quarter end, or 1.94% of total loans, compared to $12.6 billion, or 2.06% of total loans, at the end of the prior year period. Total non-accrual assets grew 6% from the prior year period to $5.8 billion. Consumer non-accrual loans declined 14% to $3.2 billion. Corporate non-accrual loans increased 52% to $2.4 billion, primarily related to energy-related loans in ICG, but were unchanged from the prior quarter.", "tag-16": "Citigroup's loans were $624 billion as of quarter end, up 1% from the prior year period, and 3% in constant dollars.

Citigroup's Supplementary Leverage Ratio for the fourth quarter 2016 was 7.2%, up from 7.1% in the prior year period, driven by an increase in Tier 1 Capital which more than offset a slight increase in leverage exposure. During the fourth quarter 2016, Citigroup repurchased approximately 79 million common shares and returned a total of $4.7 billion to common shareholders in the form of common share repurchases and dividends.

This decrease was driven by lower loan loss reserve builds, in particular in ICG, partially offset by higher net credit losses in GCB.

Citi-branded cards revenues of $2.2 billion increased 15%, reflecting the addition of the Costco portfolio as well as modest organic growth driven by higher volumes. Citi retail services revenues of $1.6 billion were largely flat, as growth in core portfolios was offset by the absence of revenue from portfolio exits and the continued impact of previously-disclosed partnership renewals. Retail banking revenues declined 4% to $1.3 billion, mostly reflecting lower mortgage revenues.", "tag-27": "North America GCB net income was $844 million, down 15%, driven by an increase in cost of credit and higher operating expenses, partially offset by the higher revenues.

The net loan loss reserve build in the fourth quarter 2016 was $113 million, compared to a net loan loss reserve release of $63 million in the prior year period, mostly reflecting a reserve build in cards driven by the ongoing impact of the acquisition of the Costco portfolio and organic volume growth. Net credit losses of $1.1 billion increased 21%, driven by the Costco portfolio acquisition, volume growth and seasoning, and the impact of regulatory changes on collections in the cards businesses.", "tag-29": "International GCB revenues decreased 3% to $2.9 billion. In constant dollars, revenues increased 5%. On such basis, revenues in Latin America GCB of $1.2 billion increased 8%, driven by growth in retail loans and deposits, partially offset by lower card revenues. Revenues in Asia GCB of $1.7 billion increased 4%, driven by growth in wealth management and cards revenues.", "tag-30": "International GCB net income increased 14% to $421 million.

ICG cost of credit included net credit losses of $119 million ($96 million in the prior year period) and a net loan loss reserve release of $15 million (net loan loss reserve build of $554 million in the prior year period).
