We're talking here about a regular report from Standard & Poor's, a unit of McGraw-Hill, that's known as SPIVA, short for Standard & Poor's Indices Versus Active. This scorecard compares the performance of actively managed funds to an appropriate benchmark index.

Whether S&P analyzed funds in broad categories, such as all large-cap U.S. stock funds, or sliced the data more finely by looking at, say, New York municipal-bond funds, it found that a majority of funds lagged behind their category's benchmark index.", "tag-4": "To this picture of failure, there were just three exceptions. A majority of emerging-market debt funds, international small-cap stock funds and large-cap U.S. value stock funds outpaced their category's benchmark index over the past five calendar years, according to the S&P study.", "tag-5": "The overall poor showing shouldn't be a big surprise. Yes, money managers are often incredibly smart and incredibly well-informed. Problem is, they are competing against other incredibly smart, incredibly well-informed investors. And even if they manage to pick securities that post market-beating results, their overall performance may not be market-beating once costs are factored in, including money-management fees and trading costs.", "tag-6": "To be sure, if you opt for index funds instead of actively managed funds, you will also incur investment expenses. But because the costs charged by index funds are usually much lower, you're less likely to underperform the target index by a wide margin--and thus you should fare better than most actively managed funds that invest in the same part of the market.", "tag-7": "INVESTMENT PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022 NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-8": "The information provided here is for informational purposes only.
