Despite its size, National City Bank was not spared the massive runs on deposits that were taking place at banks across the country. According to James Perkins, who succeeded Charles Mitchell as the bank's chairman in 1933, average gross deposits fell from $1.26 billion in the week ending February 18 to $967 million in the week ending March 25. Speaking at the annual meeting of shareholders in early 1934, Perkins acknowledged that the situation had been \"acute,\" but noted that by the end of 1933, deposits had partially recovered, to $1.12 billion. Four years after the 1929 crash, however, the Great Depression was still taking its toll on the bank. Operational systems had been reviewed, expenses had been reduced by more than $1.5 million, and executive salaries had been cut. Moreover, no management fund or other extra compensation plan for employees had been in place for three years. Since becoming chairman, Perkins had persuaded the board to set aside an additional $30 million as a contingency reserve and cut the dividend from the annual rate of $2 a share to $1 a share. Yet the bank was still profitable, especially the foreign branch network, which was maintained largely intact under Perkins' tenure. Perkins was not always a believer in overseas branches. During the bank moratorium of 1933, declared by President Roosevelt to prevent a bank run due to lack of public confidence, National City Bank's competitors predicted that the overseas branches would bleed the bank dry of funds. However, such was public trust in National City Bank, that during the closure in the United States the overseas branches showed a shrinkage of less than 2 percent in their deposits. One day, Joseph Durrell, head of the overseas division, showed a gloomy Perkins offers of assistance from friendly competitors, as well as the previous night's reserve sheets, indicating that the bank's cash balance abroad amounted to 73 percent of its branch deposits. At that moment, Perkins became a staunch supporter of the overseas division. Perkins reported, \"Under anything like normal conditions the foreign branches make handsome earnings and contribute largely through their services to the building up of domestic deposits.\" Foreign exchange earnings were said to be particularly brisk in China, which used a silver rather than a gold standard for its currency and was largely shielded from the global downturn. Although the U.S. economy improved during the 1930s, it took more than a decade for the country's gross domestic product to return to its 1929 level."}
