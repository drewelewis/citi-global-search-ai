Her ability to leverage the heat of the Habanero and Scotch bonnet peppers against the sweet taste of the Caribbean guavas and pineapples is a testament to her creativity and dedication to her craft.", "tag-5": "Here at Citi, we are extremely excited to support Sonya Samuel as she expands her business. For many up-and-coming chefs, accruing a solid customer base, raising start-up capital and locking down a prime location are insurmountable barriers to entry. Through the Citi Test Kitchen, Citi is helping promising chefs overcome these barriers. I encourage you to join us as we support these culinary entrepreneurs by trying some of Sonya Samuel's Bacchanal Sauce for yourself. The Citi Test Kitchen is located at Urbanspace @ 570 Lex, on the corner of 51st Street and Lexington Avenue."}
