Lee of San Francisco and Bob Annibale of Citi Community Development in Washington, D.C. as they accepted the 2013 Excellence Award for Public-Private Partnerships from the Mayors' Business Council of the US Conference of Mayors. The award honors the unique public-private partnership between the City and County of San Francisco, Citi Community Development and Citibank for San Francisco's Kindergarten to College program.", "tag-4": "What is Kindergarten to College (K2C)?", "tag-5": "The City and County of San Francisco's Kindergarten to College (K2C) initiative is the nation's first universal college savings account program. Launched in 2010, K2C is designed to embed a savings culture among San Francisco's children as a driver to expanding college access and increasing college completion rates by automatically opening a savings account for every child entering the City's public schools in kindergarten. Public-private partnership is at the center of the program, supporting the identity, operation and success of K2C.", "tag-6": "Why was K2C developed?", "tag-7": "Over the course of a lifetime, people with college degrees earn 75 percent more than those with just high-school diplomas - nearly one million dollars more in total. Yet for many of San Francisco's low- and moderate-income (LMI) families, achieving those degrees means overcoming huge financial obstacles. Even after loans, scholarships and other aid, out-of-pocket costs for higher education often are unsustainable. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau now reports more than $1 trillion in outstanding student loan debt. When applying for college, why should a student be forced to make the choice: take on significant debt or drop out? There is a third option: Save. It is proven that given the opportunity, low-income households not only will save but also will use those savings to invest in long-term assets - including education - that create pathways to financial security. Research has shown that a child with a savings account is six times more likely to attend college. Even modest savings can provide the foundation for young people to begin paying for their education while instilling sound financial behaviors that will serve them throughout their lives. In San Francisco, however, one in three children is born into a family with no savings or assets of any kind. The City and County of San Francisco decided to make the dream of college a reality for every child, by launching a program to automatically open a college savings account for every child, starting in kindergarten.", "tag-8": "Who is involved in the program?", "tag-9": "The City and County of San Francisco, led by the Office of the Mayor and the Office of the Treasurer, partnered with the San Francisco Unified School District, Citi, the Corporation for Enterprise Development (CFED), philanthropists and local community groups to design and support the country's first universal, automatic and publicly funded college savings account program. In 2012, San Francisco Mayor Edwin Lee and the Board of Supervisors approved funding in the city's budget to expand the two-year pilot into a universal program providing savings accounts for every child entering kindergarten.", "tag-10": "How does K2C work?", "tag-11": "Every child entering kindergarten in the San Francisco Unified School District is automatically given a college savings account at Citibank. To facilitate this, Citi created a platform where accounts can be opened and managed electronically. The account initially contains $50 from the City and County of San Francisco and an additional $50 to students who qualify for free and reduced lunch. Once the student has an account, the program provides opportunities for matched savings and incentives and encouragement for families to increase their savings. For example, K2C offers a one-to-one match for the first $100 saved by a family and an additional \"Save Steady\" bonus of $100 for families that make six consecutive monthly deposits of $10 or more. Financial education is a core component of K2C and participating schools have integrated relevant financial subjects into their math curricula. Starting in kindergarten, K2C also provides a Citi-powered web-based tool - mysavingsaccount.com/K2C - that teachers use to help students and their families manage the accounts. This makes San Francisco the first city in the nation to link financial education to a real-life savings account.", "tag-12": "What has been the impact?", "tag-13": "Nearly 8,000 accounts are now open with every child entering kindergarten in the San Francisco Unified School District automatically start their academic career with a college savings account in his or her name, starting this school year. A total of more than $180,000 in families' own money has been saved; of this, 65% is from families on the free and reduced lunch program. K2C marks a watershed in financial inclusion, providing a blueprint for public-private collaborations leading to both greater opportunity for college success and participation in the financial mainstream. Instilling the value of saving in a child as early as Kindergarten will better prepare them for the financial responsibilities that accompany college completion. College savings programs along with supportive public policies, and the know-how and incentives to implement them wisely, can create a brighter future for the next generation that includes better jobs and a stronger economy."}
