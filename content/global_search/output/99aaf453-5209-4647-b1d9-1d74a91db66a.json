We're both deeply rooted New York City institutions that are committed to education. The Museum has been our client for 40 years and we've been philanthropic partners since 1989.", "tag-4": "Citi invests heavily in initiatives that put students on the path to success. We see it not only as our duty, but it's in our interest. That's why we have contributed more than $4 million to increase the Museum's capacity to enrich the lives of visitors and students from around the world since 1989. We're proud to continue that tradition through establishing a new $250,000 Citi Foundation grant in support of the museum's educational programming. Starting this summer, the grant will be used to provide children with access to exhibitions, and to underwrite the cost of classes, research projects and mentoring.", "tag-5": "For children, exploring the museum and seeing the displays can be life-changing. Whether they're walking the evolutionary trail, standing under the 94-foot-long blue whale, or taking a \"journey to the stars,\" kids leave with a new sense of wonderment. That experience doesn't happen just anywhere and Citi is honored to be part of it.", "tag-6": "Special thanks to all the attendees and donors for their commitment to ensuring that the American Museum of Natural History will continue to serve millions of visitors and students every year.", "tag-7": "For information on ways to support the museum, check out: https://www.amnh.org/join-support.", "tag-8": "Photo credit:", "tag-9": "\u00a9"}
