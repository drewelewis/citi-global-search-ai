Guillaume Gauthereau (this week's live chat host -- RSVP here) is living proof that they're not.", "tag-3": "In just three years, Guillaume, co-founder/CEO of Totsy, has transformed his company into the second largest U.S. private sale site for moms and kids, with over 5 million members and a nod from Forbes as one of \"America's Most Promising Companies.\" He's also raised $35M in funding.", "tag-4": "But Totsy is more than just a wildly successful sale site -- it also reflects Guillaume's personal commitment to social responsibility. (We hear it's the only carbon-neutral and socially responsible flashsale company in the country!)", "tag-5": "Before Totsy, Guillaume spent 15 years in the retail and luxury industry, learning the ropes in various executive roles. Most recently, at Lalique North America and UK, he was the youngest CEO of an international luxury retail company -- as icing on the cake, he also closed the largest transaction in that company's history. Since then, he's been featured on CNN, CBS, CNBC and dozens more; New York's Mayor Bloomberg even named him a NYC Venture Fellow for his role creating jobs.", "tag-6": "Did we mention he's also a trained beekeeper who preserves endangered fruit trees in his Catskills orchard?", "tag-7": "...And one of the most inspiring leaders we've ever met?", "tag-8": "\"We talk about our career choices as if they are mutually exclusive: either you make tons of money and buy fancy things you never have the time to enjoy, or you do what you love and live in poverty, but you're happy.\" writes Guillaume.", "tag-9": "\"But we are not animals living in the Serengeti anymore. We are not going to die if we leave the herd. Quite the contrary: it's where we go to thrive.", "tag-10": "\"Once you start forgetting about what you should do and how, and removing the old constraints and limits and fears - salary, what will others think, is this something I know how to do - all these fears restrict the possibilities you can explore. When you remove that, there's a whole new world of possibilities out there.\"", "tag-11": "If you want to learn more about how this Ph.D.-turned-serial entrepreneur went from veterinary medicine to being one of the most successful and socially conscious young CEOs we know, tune in this Thursday, January 31st at 3 PM EST for our hour-long #StartupLab live chat presented by Citi. Bring your best questions for Guillaume -- about sales, about the luxury market, about social entrepreneurship but most of all, about doing what you love.", "tag-12": "Click here to RSVP to chat live with Guillaume Gauthereau this Thursday at 3pm EST!"}
