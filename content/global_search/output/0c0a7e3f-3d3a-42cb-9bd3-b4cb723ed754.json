The pilot program will study whether financial education and coaching combined with an innovative secured credit-card platform can increase credit scores and expand the small businesses of more than 600 low-income entrepreneurs in five markets nationwide. The study is funded by a $750,000 grant from the Citi Foundation.", "tag-1": "U.S.: The Aspen Institute and Citi to Study Innovative Credit-Building Model for Entrepreneurs", "tag-2": "HIGHLIGHTS", "tag-3": "Washington, D.C. \u2013 The Aspen Institute announced today the launch of the Asset Building Through Credit pilot program, a research effort that will study a multi-dimensional approach to building credit and financial opportunities for aspiring low-income entrepreneurs.

The Aspen Institute will also provide training, technical assistance and a series of ongoing peer learning activities to support the pilot. A thorough evaluation and assessment of the program will determine if the approach is effective and scalable.", "tag-5": "\"One of the Citi Foundation's core goals is to increase the number of sustainable microenterprises that generate new income and employment opportunities for low- to moderate-income individuals,\" said Pamela Flaherty, President & CEO of the Citi Foundation. \"Through our support of the Asset Building Through Credit program, we hope to analyze how community-based intermediaries can advance that goal and drive widespread adoption of new approaches that will allow microentrepreneurs to obtain the financing they need to grow and succeed.\"", "tag-6": "In today's economy, a good credit score is an important financial asset that allows small-business owners to access resources and, in many instances, reduce operating costs. Over the past two years, high U.S. unemployment levels have led to an increase in the number of credit applications from individuals who are motivated to start their own businesses but whose damaged or thin credit histories make it challenging for even community-based nonprofit microlenders to provide loans. Research has shown that the best way to expand financial capability and build (or rebuild) an individual's credit score is to pair appropriate financial products with education and counseling.", "tag-7": "The initiative is based on a successful program led by Justine PETERSEN, a St. Louis-based microlender that has been offering secured cards to its microenterprise clients for almost two years. Citi Microfinance has collaborated with the organization to develop its credit building model and technology platform. Justine PETERSEN will play a key role in the Aspen Institute's pilot project by advising the participating nonprofits on how to use secured cards as a financial coaching and credit building tool.", "tag-8": "\"We know from conversations with microenterprise programs across the country that they are seeing increasing numbers of would-be entrepreneurs whose credit histories pose a challenge in building their businesses,\" says Elaine Edgcomb, Director of the FIELD program at the Aspen Institute. \"This pilot will test a new approach that can help these entrepreneurs build their credit and their financial skills, and consequently increase their likelihood of business success. If successful, we hope this is an approach that many of the other hundreds of microenterprise organizations in the U.S. can offer.\"", "tag-9": "The selected local partners each have longstanding experience in working with entrepreneurs, and in providing financial education and credit-building services to low-income individuals.
