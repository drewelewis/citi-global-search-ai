Accordingly, the Citi Foundation supports community-based lenders, including Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) that provide access to capital, financial products and wrap-around services to small businesses. However, we believe access to capital and products alone is not enough. Financial capability\u2014the ability to establish financial plans and develop strategies for preserving a strong financial position during times of both economic prosperity and instability\u2014is critical to the financial well-being and upward economic mobility of individuals and communities."}
