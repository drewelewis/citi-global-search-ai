With Citi's support, PMN has been able to set up industry infrastructure for knowledge management and information-sharing through its two online products. PMN also has established a credit bureau, which will help in improving information symmetries at the client level. PMN has developed links with academic institutions to help in providing good quality HR for the industry and is also engaged in building links with the media to remove misconceptions surrounding microfinance.", "tag-5": "Citi's Country Officer Arif Usmani said, \"Our partnership with PMN has played a vital role in strengthening the capacity-building of the microfinance sector in Pakistan.

This training program will conclude with a best practice research note on lessons learned from recent disasters, so as to enable the sector to preempt risks in the future.
