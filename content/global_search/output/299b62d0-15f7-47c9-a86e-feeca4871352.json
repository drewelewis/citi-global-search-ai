The study assessed indicators in a variety of areas related to both business and family.", "tag-3": "The results of the study, which was carried out by RMC and Citi Foundation, confirmed that microfinancing plays an important social role. Ninety percent of respondents noted higher business profitability as a result of using the services of microfinance organizations, 55 percent reported an increase in assets, 36 percent \u2013 job creation, and 30 percent \u2013 expansion of business geography.

This means that the development of microfinancing for business could help accomplish important social tasks \u2013 the development of the middle class and realization of citizens' entrepreneurial potential.\"", "tag-12": "This is the first time that such a study has been conducted in Russia.
