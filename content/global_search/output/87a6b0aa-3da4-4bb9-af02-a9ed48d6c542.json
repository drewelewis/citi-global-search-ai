It does not accurately reflect the significant progress Citi has made since Moody's last rated Citi more than two-and-a-half years ago. Regardless, we believe that less than 1% of Citi's funding will be affected by the Moody's decision and the downgrade will not affect the short-term and long-term funding of our bank vehicles.", "tag-1": "Citi Statement on Moody's Announcement", "tag-2": "\"Although we are pleased that Moody's affirmed both the long-term and short-term ratings of Citibank, N.A. and the long-term rating of Citigroup, we completely disagree with Moody's change to Citigroup's short-term rating.
