The investing partners view the new fund as a prototype for potential expansion and roll-out to other cities.", "tag-4": "The initiative combines growth financing with the sophisticated expertise business owners need to expand in a tough environment. \"Management expertise is as critical as capital in getting a company to the next level,\" says Next Street President Ronald L. Walker, II. \"We're bringing a Fortune 500 skillset to urban small business.\"", "tag-5": "Next Street delivers financing and strategic advice to companies with annual revenues of $5 million to $60 million that are already significant employers in urban markets. The Opportunity Fund will support business owners in low- and moderate-income communities with strategic planning, organizational development and marketing services. Using the firm's advisory services is a requirement for access to the fund.", "tag-6": "\"We are proud to invest in the Next Street Opportunity Fund and show our deep commitment to supporting small businesses,\" said Vikram Pandit, Chief Executive Officer of Citigroup. \"Helping small companies grow and create jobs strengthens our communities and is critical to the economic recovery.

Preserving local ownership and expanding job growth are objectives for the fund.", "tag-9": "The local nature of the fund was one of many reasons Enterprise found the fund attractive. \"Enterprise helps to create healthy, thriving communities,\" says Lori Chatman Enterprise Community Loan Fund President. \"With the Next Street Opportunity Fund, we're looking forward to working with Citi and Next Street to provide greater access to employment opportunities and to increase investment in urban markets, both necessary components for successful neighborhoods.\"", "tag-10": "Next Street serves as a strategic advisor to the business owner, much like a private equity firm would for their investees, but growth financing is in the form of a loan, rather than a majority stake of the company. This makes the Next Street model more attractive than private equity to family-owned firms.", "tag-11": "Next Street founder Tim Ferguson describes the firm as a merchant bank for the urban enterprise. \"We can make credit decisions based on a company's potential, not just its history, because we're inside the business working with the owner and her team helping them realize that potential.\"", "tag-12": "Citi, Enterprise, and Next Street expect that growth capital will begin flowing to high-potential small companies this year.", "tag-13": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
