A silver lining to the results is the American public's self assessment, which remains largely unchanged. Sixty percent remain somewhat or very optimistic about their own personal economic situation over the next 12 months while 36 percent are somewhat or very pessimistic.

A silver lining to the results is the American public's self assessment, which remains largely unchanged. Sixty percent remain somewhat or very optimistic about their own personal economic situation over the next 12 months while 36 percent are somewhat or very pessimistic.", "tag-4": "The survey, conducted by Hart Research Associates, found that at the start of 2011, a majority (63 percent) of Americans believed that local business conditions would be improving by the end of the year, but now, with the year more than half over, only a minority (41 percent) expects improvement within the next 12 months.", "tag-5": "\"These survey results bring into sharp relief the degree to which the confidence of even the most optimistic consumers has been shaken by a tumultuous summer,\" said Michelle Peluso, Global Consumer Chief Marketing and Internet Officer, Citi. \"Although consumers' current circumstances remain largely unchanged, expectations that things will improve in the foreseeable future have declined. And yet, consumers remain resilient and hopeful that their personal situations will improve.\"", "tag-6": "Among the survey's key findings:", "tag-7": "Citibank Economic Pulse Declines  The Citibank Economic Pulse, a quarterly measure of public attitudes toward the economy, dropped 5 points to minus 17, the lowest level in the Pulse's two-year history. Most of the decline in the Pulse, which combines eight survey questions into a single measure, is seen among college educated and upper-income Americans who held more optimistic views of the future in January but have now lowered expectations to levels more in line with other Americans. The most affluent group, those earning over $150,000 in household income, dropped 8 points to +4 while college educated Americans dropped 9 points to -10, bringing them closer to their more financially stressed non-college educated peers, now at minus 21.", "tag-8": "Financial Security: Staying Healthy and Being Your Own Boss Three years after the downturn began, the survey reveals 44 percent of Americans feel less financially secure now than they did at the start of the economic downturn in 2008. Only 10 percent of consumers reported feeling more financially secure, while 45 percent reported feeling about the same.", "tag-9": "\"Two years after the economy started rebounding, the level of financial insecurity is extremely high,\" said Jonathan Clements, Director of Financial Education, Citi Personal Wealth Management. \"It shows just how profoundly consumers have been impacted by the recent economic and political turmoil.\"", "tag-10": "As consumers continue to weather the downturn, the survey found that the top factor cited for financial security today is staying healthy (45 percent), followed closely by having a secure job (41 percent). Slightly more than three in 10 Americans (32 percent) cited avoiding debt, but other factors such as having an emergency fund (17 percent), owning your own home (16 percent), and having a college degree (15 percent) were noted.", "tag-11": "When it comes to staying financially secure in today's economy, nearly a third of Americans (32 percent) believe that being their own boss is best. Working for a large corporation (24 percent) and the federal government (21 percent) are also viewed as safer employment options than working for a small business (17 percent) or for a state or local government (15 percent).", "tag-12": "Feeling the Pinch: Consumers Get Savvy When it comes to saving and spending, Americans are increasingly concerned about paying for necessities like food and gasoline, with significant proportions of Americans making deep and permanent changes to the way they save and spend.", "tag-13": "Americans are not just trimming the fat from their personal finances, but making deep cuts:", "tag-14": "Americans are also becoming savvier consumers:", "tag-15": "\"After a summer filled with debt negotiations and a credit-rating downgrade, we spoke with Americans when the stock market was particularly volatile. All of this has clearly taken a toll on consumer confidence,\" said pollster Peter D. Hart, who conducted the survey. \"It will be interesting to see if America's mood brightens in the next quarter.\"", "tag-16": "In Citibank's quarterly surveys, the percentage of consumers who believe things are forever changed has steadily increased from 51 percent in September 2010 to 52 percent (January 2011) to 54 percent (April 2011) to 57 percent today.", "tag-17": "Survey Methodology The Citibank Economic Pulse survey is a quarterly survey focused on consumer sentiment regarding the current and future economic environment. The Random Digit Dialing (RDD) survey was conducted by Hart Research Associates from August 6-11, among a random sample of 2,006 adults nationally. The design includes interviews with mobile phone respondents. The margin of error for the entire sample is approximately +/- 2.2 percentage points. The margin of error is higher for subgroups. In addition to sampling error, surveys are also subject to many other sources of bias or error, including sampling coverage error, recording error and respondent error.", "tag-18": "Pulse Methodology The Citi Economic Pulse is calculated by subtracting negative responses to each item from the positive responses for 8 Pulse items, divided by 8. The 8 Pulse items include: current condition of the economy in area; business conditions in area over the next twelve months; current employment opportunities in area; buying climate for big ticket items; personal financial situation compared to a year ago; outlook on personal financial situation for the next twelve months; comfort with current level of savings; and comfort with current level of debt. The Pulse scale can range from +100 (if every respondent gave positive response to each of the 8 questions) to -100 (if all respondents expressed consistently negative views).", "tag-19": "Citi Citi, the leading global financial services company, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
