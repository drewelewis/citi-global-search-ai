Thank you for continuing to share your ideas and concerns. Your feedback helps us understand where we can do better, and helps guide our improvements to deliver the experience you deserve. We have heard that you want simpler ways to manage your account, easier ways to save money on purchases, and more ways to enjoy the ThankYou Rewards you have earned. Here is an update on some recent changes and updates we have made based on this feedback. <br><br><strong>You told us getting lower prices is important to you when making purchases, and when there is a difference in price it should be easy to get money back. We agree. </strong>Citi Price Rewind is a complimentary benefit to help you save on purchases after checkout -- to date, we have found a lower price for one out of every four registered items over $100. The average refund for cardmembers who have submitted a claim is $80! For those of you who have not tried it yet, simply shop with your Citi card and register your purchase with us online. We will search hundreds of retailers' web sites for a lower price for 30 days after your purchase. If we find your item at a price at least $25 less than what you paid, you can request a refund for the difference. Check out a full description of the program, including eligible purchases <a href=\"https://www.citipricerewind.com/l____.htm\">here</a> . And please let us know what you think so we can keep making your experience better. <br><strong><br>Your time is valuable, and we have heard you want activating and managing your credit card to be simpler.</strong> Now, when you receive a new Citi credit card in the mail, we will provide a URL where you can activate the card online quickly and easily, along with the phone number right on the sticker. <br><br>We also know some of you were disappointed when the download version of our Virtual Account Number (VAN) functionality was paused in December to make some necessary updates. This is a free service which allows cardmembers to generate a substitute credit card number which can be used in place of their real credit card number during online or telephone shopping. While only a small number of you used our VAN functionality, we want you to know we heard loud and clear that you want to continue using this service. We will be bringing this back at the end of April and will send you a notification when it is available again. <br><br><strong>You told us that having more ways to use your ThankYou\u00ae Rewards is important to you.</strong> Last year, we introduced new options, and you will continue to see more this year. If you check out <a href=\"https://www.thankyou.com/\">thankyou.com</a> today, you will see a spring catalog full of items from brands like Nike\u00ae, Sony\u00ae, and Nikon\u00ae, to name a few. You told us you like receiving these catalogs so we are happy to send them in 2013. And when you are redeeming for merchandise from Best Buy\u00ae, you can enjoy your electronics right away by selecting the option to pick them up at your local Best Buy store. <br><br>We also want to remind you if you have a Citi credit card enrolled in ThankYou Rewards, you can use your ThankYou Points to shop for millions of eligible products at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/\">Amazon.com</a>. You can either use ThankYou points for your entire purchase at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/\">Amazon.com</a>, or use a combination of Points and your Citi credit card. We are glad so many of you have already enjoyed this new feature, and we are working to provide more choices like this in the future. <br><br>You also told us that it should be easier to find your account information on thankyou.com, so we changed it. There is now a tab, My Account, at the top left navigation where you can find all of your account details on <a href=\"https://www.thankyou.com/\">thankyou.com</a>. <br><br>You can count on more updates soon as we continue to work to earn your business and your trust.
