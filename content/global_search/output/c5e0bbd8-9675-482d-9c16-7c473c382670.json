The program, a partnership between Conservation International, Natural Partners and Refloresta with the support of Citi Brazil and the Citi Foundation, is an initiative to develop and qualify tree nurseries to contribute to reforestation in critical areas of the Atlantic Forest in Rio de Janeiro state. In addition to awarding the first round of certificates in the program, the presentation is designed to encourage contacts between potential producers and the groups with the most demand for seedlings in the state.", "tag-1": "Conservation International Presents Results of Tree Nursery Qualification Project", "tag-2": "HIGHLIGHTS", "tag-3": "S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 Pr\u00f3-Viveiros will present the results of its pilot project at the Rio de Janeiro State Industries Federation (FIRJAN) auditorium on April 20.

The participating nurseries also received technical guidance about the regulations for seedling production, facilitating their incorporation into the National Seed and Seedling Registry (Renasem). The first phase of the project was composed of individual producers and small businesses. Production capacity depends on the nurseries' output, which ranges from 30,000 to 200,000 seedlings annually.", "tag-7": "\"The role of the Pr\u00f3-Viveiros program is not to produce seedlings,\" Mesquita explained, \"but rather to qualify the state's nurseries from both the technical standpoint and in terms of business management, so that seed and seedling production \u2013 the basis of the reforestation productive chain \u2013 can be strengthened and consolidated as a relevant segment of the state's green economy.\" By helping nurseries expand their business, he maintained, the initiative will generate jobs and income in economically disadvantaged areas.", "tag-8": "In the first phase of the pilot program, 12 nurseries successfully joined the Ministry of Agriculture's National Seed and Seedling Registry (Renasem), a prerequisite for supplying large-scale public or private projects. The other two nurseries involved in the pilot program were already on the registry. At the beginning of the project, none of the 14 had a business plan, an essential element for successful planning and management. By the end of the program, all of the participating nurseries will have a business plan in hand.", "tag-9": "The partnership with Conservation International and Citi Brazil on this project comes at an important time for the country and the state, with a number of large-scale construction projects and major sporting events in the works. As part of the preparations for the 2016 Olympic Games, for example, the Rio de Janeiro state government has committed to planting 24 million trees, in part to compensate for the CO2 emissions the event is expected to generate. Pr\u00f3-Viveiros's goal is to support SMEs in the state's forestry sector by enabling them to qualify for business opportunities associated with the restoration of the Atlantic Forest.", "tag-10": "Conservation International  Conservation International (CI) is a non-profit organization founded in 1987 with the goal of promoting human well-being by empowering societies to responsibly and sustainably care for nature, our global biodiversity, building upon a strong foundation of science, partnership and field demonstration.
