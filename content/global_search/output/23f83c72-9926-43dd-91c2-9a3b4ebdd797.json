As the Founder and Editor in Chief of This Big City--an online publication sharing ideas and encouraging discussion about sustainable cities--I've seen, through research and interviews, that in addition to the economic and population challenges, inequality, system management and migration are three challenges cities across the world increasingly face.", "tag-3": "\u2022 Inequality--Inequality is still prevalent, and goes far beyond gentrification. For instance, do all citizens have access to the same resources? Are poor neighborhoods as well-served by public transport as more affluent areas? If not, how can we expand existing infrastructure to ensure no one is left behind?", "tag-4": "\u2022 System management--Building density into existing systems is another challenge. How can public transport and the built environment adjust to increasing urban populations?", "tag-5": "\u2022 Migration--Migration is likely to become a bigger issue in the future, especially as our climate continues to change and people are drawn to more habitable and successful regions.", "tag-6": "The biggest single challenge facing cities, and indeed the world, is how to manage all of these challenges in a sustainable manner. A solution can only be right if it is sustainable. And one way to get to such solutions: creativity.", "tag-7": "There is creativity in every city, and celebrating what is already there is an important first step. Citizens and organizations need to embrace the creative successes of their cities if they want to see more projects take place. Funding should also be available for individuals and start-up organizations looking to establish themselves in the creative industries. The best collaborative environment is one of equality, and if there are whole portions of a city's population essentially being denied the opportunity to engage with the creativity of their city, you're never going to have a true creative culture.", "tag-8": "Sharing", "tag-9": "Examples of applying creative thinking to local challenges are the solutions that have emerged under the \"sharing\" trend. \"Sharing\" is the next great urban innovation, and it doesn't really require much budget or technical development. This is a trend we're already seeing:", "tag-10": "\u2022 Airbnb--Founded in August of 2008, Airbnb is a trusted community marketplace for people to list, discover, and book unique accommodations around the world--online or from a mobile device. Whether an apartment for a night, a castle for a week, or a villa for a month, Airbnb connects people to unique travel experiences, at any price point, in more than 33,000 cities and 192 countries.", "tag-11": "\u2022 Bike Sharing--Bike sharing programs, such as Citi Bike, which recently launched in New York City, allow people to rent a public bike as a way of getting from one point to another.", "tag-12": "\u2022 Lyft--Lyft, which started in San Francisco and now operates in many cities across the U.S., is an on-demand ridesharing app for local passengers trying to get from point A to point B.", "tag-13": "This is only the beginning. One single tool, such as AirBnB, is never going to single-handedly save the world. But if we take the sharing concept even further, we're moving in a direction that could genuinely make a difference to the wellbeing of the planet. Sharing gives us the opportunity to maintain our quality of life in a much more sustainable manner, and potentially build community in the process. Digital tools already exist or are in the works to facilitate sharing on a local level. I'm very excited to see how it pans out.", "tag-14": "Here at This Big City, we feel that by promoting ideas and discussion about sustainable cities, we can create a better future for everyone. Subsequently, we are proud to support the FT/Citi Ingenuity Awards: Urban Ideas in Action--a global program developed by The Financial Times in partnership with Citi, which aims to provide modern solutions to urban problems."}
