This year, the theme of the awards is \"Powering Youth,\" focusing on the steps taken, often by young people themselves, to support those affected by youth violence. This theme is not new to the Citi Foundation from its prior role as a leading supporter of The Evening Standard Dispossessed Fund's \"Save London Lives\" campaign.", "tag-4": "The three winning groups will receive capacity-building awards of \u00a330,000, and up to three 'Young Leaders with Impact' between the ages of 18 and 30 will receive up to \u00a32,000 to invest in their own professional development. We hope this show of support will help these groups and individuals look to the future with greater confidence, and that their stories provide real inspiration to everyone working in the critical field of youth empowerment.", "tag-5": "We're looking forward to receiving great applications.
