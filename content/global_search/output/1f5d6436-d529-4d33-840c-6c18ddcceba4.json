Because he's done something extremely cool with his business know-how and seriously big hometown love: he's catalyzed a Massachusetts startup renaissance.", "tag-5": "John, an MIT MBA, has major biz chops. He won the MIT business plan competition in school -- a $100K prize! -- and nabbed the Patrick J. McGovern award for impacting the visibility of entrepreneurship at MIT.", "tag-6": "But rather than graduate and build some awesome startup, he and his co-founder decided to build MassChallenge... a one-of-a-kind accelerator to start, support and foster as many startups as possible, right in Boston.", "tag-7": "Not coincidentally, this makes him the perfect person to talk to if you're thinking of starting your own business.", "tag-8": "John has literally watched hundreds of startups hatch -- and grow. And grow...", "tag-9": "In fact, the 236 startups MassChallenge supported in 2010-2011 have already raised $250 million in outside funding and created 2,150 new jobs.", "tag-10": "MassChallenge's model is unique. Unlike other accelerators, they take no equity from the companies they nurture and have no special industry requirements. Because they run their accelerator like a crowdsourced competition, they can nurture a record 125 startups at a time...who all get access to the $10M+ in in-kind support (from computers to software to mentorship to legal services and office space) MC offers its applicants.", "tag-11": "They also get to compete for $1 million in cash awards. $1 million. Last year, they handed out 3 $100K prizes and 14 $50K prizes to their startups. No strings attached!", "tag-12": "It's no surprise, then, that Boston Business Journal hailed John as one of Boston's 50 Most Influential Business Leaders last year. No biggie!", "tag-13": "This Thursday, October 18th at 3PM EST, join us on #StartupLab for an hour-long live chat with John Harthorne, presented by Citi. Bring any and all questions about startup funding, accelerators, getting an MBA, finding a co-founder, and tapping resources in your own startup community... John is an incredible resource no matter what stage your business is at!", "tag-14": "Click here to RSVP to the live chat with John Hawthorne on 10/17!"}
