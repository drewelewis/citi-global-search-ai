But be warned: Colleges may use different rules when doling out the financial aid they control.", "tag-6": "You can invest in a 529 college-savings plan, no matter what your income--and the amounts you can contribute are substantial. For instance, you're typically limited to giving another person $13,000 each year without worrying about the federal gift tax. But with a 529, parents could each invest $65,000 and count it as their gift to the child for the next five years. If you elect to treat a gift as being made over five years and you die before the end of that five-year period, that portion of the gift that was allocated to the period after your death would be included in your estate.", "tag-7": "One downside with 529s: You're limited to the investment choices offered and those choices may have high costs or poor performance. By contrast, with a Coverdell account, you have more investment freedom. But Coverdells have their own drawbacks. Annual contributions are limited to $2,000 per child. And to contribute the full $2,000, your modified adjusted gross income must be below $190,000 if you're married filing jointly and below $95,000 if you're single. Above those income thresholds, the amount you can contribute is phased out.", "tag-8": "INVESTMENT PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022 NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-9": "The information provided here is for informational purposes only.
