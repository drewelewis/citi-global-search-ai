It took place on a rock formation called \"Ancient Art,\" part of the larger geological area known as Fisher Towers, located roughly 20 miles northeast of Moab, Utah. In fact, as far as experienced rock climbing goes, the climb featured in the commercial is not thought to be particularly difficult. (We won't tell that to the film crew that had to haul cameras, lights and other equipment to Fisher Towers on foot.) What did add to the challenge in this case was the nearby helicopter that filmed it. The noise and rotor wash introduced obstacles not exactly typical for an afternoon climb. Even under those conditions, our fearless climbers made it look easy.", "tag-4": "The commercial promotes Citi's ThankYou credit card and related ThankYou Rewards program. It showcases some of the program's most valuable features, including how quickly one can amass rewards points and how easily they can be redeemed for almost anything.
