Many would say that it's not something you necessarily learn in school, but rather a character building process. However, at Citi Romania, we trust that the presence of entrepreneurship education programs and a positive image of entrepreneurial thinking within high schools are both incentives for participants to choose an entrepreneurial career later on.", "tag-1": "Citi Supports Entrepreneurial Education in Romania", "tag-2": "Entrepreneurship education is about transforming an idea into reality - opposite to academic talking about how to do it - and it takes certain strength, courage and responsibility for an individual to start an entrepreneurial venture.

Especially in times of economic crises, when new business models, particularly those leading to cost reductions, often emerge, it becomes even clearer that entrepreneurship is important for economic growth, productivity, innovation and employment.", "tag-4": "That is why we decided to strengthen our long-term partnership with Junior Achievement Romania, whose mission is to inspire and prepare the young generation to succeed in a market economy, by launching an entrepreneurial education program: \"Be Entrepreneurial!\". Through the following year, we will initiate 4500 students aged 15-17 from high-schools across Romania to entrepreneurial thinking as well as encourage them to consider a business start-up later on.", "tag-5": "With the support of high school teachers and Citibank volunteer-employees, the program will give students throughout the country the opportunity to better understand how an enterprise works, to gain basic skills to run a small business at the end of high school and to fit better in an economy driven by the triple bottom line approach: economic, ecological and socially conscious.", "tag-6": "As in Citi we do focus a lot on acting like an entrepreneur, permanently striving to fulfill our company's strategic priorities, to spend money responsibly and to protect the assets of our company, we are sure that our hands-on involvement in classrooms - working on business plans with students - will be a key success factor.", "tag-7": "I would like to take this opportunity to thank Citi Foundation for its commitment to enhancing leadership and knowledge building activities, our country top management for its support as well as all our colleagues' for their volunteer involvement and enthusiasm!"}
