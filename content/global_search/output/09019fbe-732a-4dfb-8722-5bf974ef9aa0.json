The Firm\u2019s indicative Stress Capital Buffer (\u201cSCB\u201d) requirement is 4.3%, up from the current 4.0%, and the Firm\u2019s preliminary Standardized Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital ratio regulatory requirement is 12.3%, up from the current 12.0%, effective October 1, 2023.", "tag-3": "As of March 31, 2023, Citi's Standardized CET1 capital ratio, which includes a 100-basis-point management buffer, stood at 13.44%, above the new regulatory requirement. \u00a0The Federal Reserve will provide the Firm with its final SCB requirement by August 31, 2023, and that requirement will become effective on October 1, 2023, and will remain in effect until September 30, 2024.", "tag-4": "Citi\u2019s Board of Directors approved a plan to increase the current quarterly common stock dividend of $0.51 to $0.53 per share for the third quarter of 2023. The Firm\u2019s quarterly common stock dividends are subject to approval by the Board of Directors at the customary times that those dividends are declared.", "tag-5": "Jane Fraser, Citi CEO, said: \u201cWhile we would have clearly preferred not to see an increase in our stress capital buffer, these results still demonstrate Citi\u2019s financial resilience through all economic environments, including the severely adverse scenario envisioned in the Federal Reserve\u2019s stress test. Our robust capital and liquidity position, as well as the diversification of our funding and our business model, allow Citi to continue to be a source of strength for our clients and navigate challenging macro environments securely.", "tag-6": "\u201cWe repurchased $1 billon of common stock during the second quarter, intend to increase our dividend and we will continue to evaluate capital actions on a quarter-by-quarter basis. We are completely committed to simplifying Citi, improving returns and delivering value to our shareholders,\u201d Ms. Fraser concluded.", "tag-7": "A Current Report on Form 8-K regarding this announcement can be found here.", "tag-8": "Citi is a preeminent banking partner for institutions with cross-border needs, a global leader in wealth management and a valued personal bank in its home market of the United States.
