This change to federal law adds to the existing requirement that lenders disclose or provide upon request a general reason for an adverse action credit decision.", "tag-1": "Dodd-Frank Act mandates free credit scores for prospective borrowers.", "tag-2": "Starting this month, changes to federal law require that lenders disclose to consumers certain information, including the credit score used to (1) turn down a loan application (known as an \"adverse action\") or (2) approve a loan, but not at the best available interest rate (known as a \"risk-based pricing\" decision).

And, the new rules don't affect just banks. Credit applications for service providers such as cable companies, or even security deposits on apartments, are also subject to these new requirements.", "tag-4": "Generally, \"credit score\" refers to a numeric value that attempts to predict a consumer's ability and likelihood to repay a loan. It is usually obtained from a specific consumer credit reporting agency (also known as a credit bureau) like Equifax\u00ae, Experian\u00ae or TransUnion\u00ae. However, some lenders may create their own scores. In each case, whether the score was obtained from a credit bureau or created by the lender, lenders must disclose the score if it was derived solely from information received from a credit bureau and if it was used to make the credit decision.", "tag-5": "At Citi, we have a number of consumer businesses that offer a variety of credit products. And, the notices you receive from us may look a little different depending on the Citi business involved. Notices may also look a little different depending on whether your application was declined, you did not qualify for the best interest rate available, or your current credit terms are being changed.", "tag-6": "Despite these slight differences, there are still a few things you should expect to see on every notice if a credit score was used in the decision-making process, including:", "tag-7": "It is generally a good idea for consumers to be aware of their credit score. Under a different federal law, consumers may obtain one free copy of their credit report from each of the credit bureaus per year; in some states, consumers have the right to receive more than one. You can obtain information about the guidelines in your state and information on how to obtain your credit reports by visiting www.annualcreditreport.com.", "tag-8": "Finally, in our communications with you about any application you make for credit, we include a number to call for more information.

It could also mean that your credit score was considered but was not a reason for the decision, or that the creditor may have used a credit score that did not fit the definition of the type of credit score that must be disclosed.", "tag-19": "When will I see this change?", "tag-20": "If you receive an adverse action or risk-based pricing notice after July 21, 2011, you may receive the new notices which include a credit score and related information.", "tag-21": "What is an adverse action notice?", "tag-22": "Federal regulations generally require a creditor to notify a credit applicant against whom it has taken an \"adverse action\". Adverse action is defined as the denial or revocation of credit - such as closing an existing account, a change in the terms of an existing credit arrangement, or a refusal to grant credit in substantially the amount or on substantially the terms requested. The main reason for the notice, which now includes the credit score, is to alert consumers to the existence of negative information in their credit reports, so that they have the opportunity to check their credit reports and correct any inaccurate information. Consumers may also want to use this information to improve their credit scores.", "tag-23": "What is a risk-based pricing notice?", "tag-24": "Federal regulations generally require a creditor to give consumers a risk-based pricing notice when the creditor uses a credit score to extend credit to the consumer on terms that are materially less favorable than the best terms available to a substantial proportion of consumers. The typical example includes a customer who applies for tiered pricing and does not get the best (or lowest) APR offered. Alternatively a creditor may elect to send a credit score disclosure notice to all applicants shortly after application. The main reason for the notice is to alert consumers to the existence of negative information in their credit reports, so that they have the opportunity to check their credit reports and correct any inaccurate information. Consumers may also want to use this information to improve their credit scores.", "tag-25": "What is a \"credit score\"?", "tag-26": "Generally, \"credit score\" refers to a numeric value that attempts to predict a consumer's ability and likelihood to repay a loan. It is usually obtained from a specific consumer credit reporting agency (also known as a credit bureau) like Equifax, Experian or TransUnion. However, some lenders may create their own scores. A credit score is usually calculated from information in a consumer credit report and takes into account such things as payment history, amount(s) owed, length of credit history, types of credit used and open applications for credit. It is often used by lenders to make credit decisions and to set the terms of credit offered.", "tag-27": "What is considered a \"good\" credit score?", "tag-28": "It is difficult to describe a \"good score\" because scores depend on a variety of circumstances that may be unique to each creditor. However, the new disclosures will provide not only the consumer's credit score, but also the range of possible scores; this may help consumers to understand where they fall in the range. Generally, however, the higher the credit score, the higher the credit quality. Creditors look at a number of factors when they determine whether or not to extend credit to a consumer, and/or what price to charge for that credit. Credit score is only one factor. It is also important to note that credit scores can change over time to reflect changes in a consumer's credit history. There are many websites that describe the relative quality of credit scores. Here is one: https://www.creditscoring.com/pages/bar.htm.", "tag-29": "How can I improve my credit score?", "tag-30": "Many factors impact your credit score, and the score may change over time to reflect changes in your credit history.

This information can be found on your notice, or on the consumer credit reporting agency's website.", "tag-33": "If I improve my credit score, can I reapply to Citi for credit at a later date?", "tag-34": "Yes", "tag-35": "How can I get specific information about my application for credit?", "tag-36": "You should call the number on the adverse action or risk-based pricing letter you received from Citi."}
