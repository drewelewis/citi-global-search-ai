Here's How You Can Also Help Yourself", "summary": "This time of year, many folks think about those in need, prompting them to donate money, furniture, clothes and toys. But while you're helping your favorite causes, also think about helping yourself--by being tax-smarter about your charitable giving.", "tag-1": "Helping Others? Here's How You Can Also Help Yourself", "tag-2": "This time of year, many folks think about those in need, prompting them to donate money, furniture, clothes and toys. But while you're helping your favorite causes, also think about helping yourself--by being tax-smarter about your charitable giving.", "tag-3": "For starters, avoid giving actual cash. Instead, use a check or credit card, so you'll have proof if you are ever audited by the IRS. Currently, such donations may be deductible up to 50% of your adjusted gross income. If donations exceed 50% of AGI, you can carry over the excess deduction for up to five years immediately following the deduction. If you typically take the standard deduction, consider bunching two or three years of charitable contributions into one tax year to see whether that allows you to itemize and thereby get a tax deduction for your generosity.", "tag-4": "Also consider donating appreciated stock, mutual-fund shares and other securities. That way, you can potentially avoid paying capital-gains taxes on the appreciation, while still being able to deduct the donation's current market value. To deduct the current value, however, you need to donate long-term holdings, such as a stock held for more than a year. One warning: Don't sell your securities first and then donate cash. If you do that, you will get the deduction--but you'll have to pay the capital-gains tax.", "tag-5": "Looking for not only a tax break, but also retirement income? Consider a charitable gift annuity. You contribute money or other assets to the charity, which then makes annuity payments to you for the rest of your life. You get an immediate tax deduction for part of the gift, and part of each annuity payment can be treated as a tax-free return of your investment. Also, many charities can help you set up a charitable remainder trust. You leave property or money to a charity, but continue to receive income from it while you are living.", "tag-6": "A final caveat: Keep in mind that federal tax rates may rise in 2013--which means your generosity could potentially earn you a larger tax deduction if you delay your gift until next year.", "tag-7": "INVESTMENT AND INSURANCE PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022 NOT A BANK DEPOSIT \u2022 NOT INSURED BY ANY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY \u2022 NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-8": "Citigroup, Inc. and its affiliates do not provide tax or legal advice.
