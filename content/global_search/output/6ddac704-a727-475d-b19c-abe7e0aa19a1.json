In November, Vikram Pandit signed the Statement of Employer Support for the Guard & Reserve. Earlier this month, we launched Citi Salutes, a one-stop resource that consolidates all of Citi's programs, products and partnerships that support the greater veterans community. And next month, we'll once again be helping to lead the second annual Veterans on Wall Street conference and job fair in New York, an initiative co-founded by Citi to develop career opportunities in the financial services industry for veterans.", "tag-4": "As the nation pauses to observe Memorial Day this weekend, we salute our Citi colleagues for fostering a workplace that embraces and values the patriotism and sacrifice associated with military service. Citi is the only financial services company to be named a Freedom Award finalist, and on behalf of the members of Citi's Military Veterans Networks, particularly those currently serving at home and abroad, we deeply appreciate your ongoing support.", "tag-5": "Read more about how Citi supports our veterans here"}
