These hurdles are often compounded by the high costs of required training, certification, and equipment, creating an impenetrable barrier to employment.", "tag-5": "The accelerated year-long JESA program, which commenced on October 1, is mitigating those costs by combining required financial and job-readiness training with a savings match. For each participant, after program requirements are met, CAAB will match up to $500 in client savings at an 8:1 rate. Participants who complete the program will be not only better-equipped to manage their finances and enter the workforce, but will also be bolstered with up to $4,500 (including initial client savings) to be used for additional job training or small business development costs.", "tag-6": "CAAB projects that the JESA program will serve 250 to 300 underemployed Washington-area residents, preparing them for jobs or entrepreneurship while reinforcing their financial capacity to purchase tools, uniforms, and other trade equipment. JESA participants must complete a rigorous program involving a minimum of 14 hours of financial education and jobs or entrepreneurship training with CAAB and a CAAB-approved partner, as well as attend financial coaching sessions as needed. Following the training period, participants will continue to receive coaching from CAAB and support through its \"Financial Empowerment Circles,\" which are peer-led groups of CAAB clients working towards economic self-sufficiency.", "tag-7": "\"With the JESA program, we help enrollees to execute their savings and business goals by providing hands-on support\" said Maurita Coley, Executive Director of CAAB. \"While participants are saving, we give them financial education training and one-on-one financial coaching, and our partners give them entrepreneurship and job training, all to help them to succeed in their businesses, get a job, or get a better job.\"", "tag-8": "\"We need to focus on providing our residents with clear pathways to self-sufficiency,\" said Julius Ware, President of Ward 7 Business and Professional Association and a CAAB Board Member. \"The JESA program is an innovative approach that helps Americans save and get back to work, giving them the tools needed to weather tough economic times.\"", "tag-9": "JESA makes innovative use of funds from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services' Assets for Independence (AFI) program. CAAB has been approved to use $600,000 in AFI funds that are maturing and would otherwise be forfeited, along with an equal amount of locally-raised matching funds to implement the JESA program. Citi Community Development is providing an additional $200,000 to support the JESA program and a thorough evaluation focusing on the opportunity for replication.", "tag-10": "\"Too many members of this community are locked out of the job market because they don't have the training or the resources to prepare for and access job opportunities,\" said Diana Meyer, Citi Community Development State Director for the Washington, D.C., metro area and a member of CAAB's Board. \"Citi has a record of finding innovative ways to create pathways to self-sufficiency, and the JESA program exemplifies that commitment.\"", "tag-11": "Savings accounts for participants, who must meet federal income requirements and must have some earned income, will be held at local Citibank branches.", "tag-12": "1 Source: Washington, D.C.
