As Patrick Curley, a VP at Citi, told the blog about his third two-year match, \"I can honestly say that [my mentee] is an exceptional kid -- always smiling, selfless and always looking for ways to help others. Not seeing [him] graduate and go off to college is not an option as far as I am concerned, so he and I are focused on getting him all the resources he needs to finish school and get into a top college.\"", "tag-4": "Citi volunteers are working with students across New York City, but have a particularly strong presence at ACORN Community High School in Crown Heights, Brooklyn, where 20 Citi volunteers are matched for three and a half years, from sophomore year of high school through freshman year of college. More information about the program, which aims to match 2,400 pairs this year, is available at www.imentor.org."}
