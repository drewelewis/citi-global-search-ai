Throughout this crisis, we have served as a source of strength for our customers, clients and communities and have embraced the opportunity to help lead the economic relief and recovery efforts. Our targeted Common Equity Tier 1 Capital ratio already contemplates periodic volatility in regulatory capital requirements under the SCB framework. We look forward to continuing with our planned capital actions, including common dividends of at least $0.51 per share, and to continuing share repurchases, which are particularly attractive when our stock price is below tangible book value per share. Citi remains committed to continuing to invest in our franchise as part of the firm's broader strategy refresh as well as continuing to return any excess capital to shareholders given the flexibility provided by the SCB framework.", "tag-5": "By the end of the first two quarters of this year, Citi will have returned to shareholders the maximum amount of capital permitted under Federal Reserve rules. All planned capital actions are subject to financial and macroeconomic conditions, and approval by Citi's Board of Directors.", "tag-6": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
