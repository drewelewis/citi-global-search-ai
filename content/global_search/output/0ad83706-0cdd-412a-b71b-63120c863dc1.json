However, only less than five percent of people (4.7 percent) call on their bank in person to terminate such services.", "tag-1": "Citi Study Shows Czechs Preference for Online and Mobile Banking", "tag-2": "Prague \u2013 According to a survey conducted by Citi, for 50 percent of Czechs, obtaining information or consulting on a particular requirement with their banker are the reasons for visiting a bank. Only one-fifth of Czechs (19.9 percent) go to bank branches to set up a new service or file an application for a banking product. However, only less than five percent of people (4.7 percent) call on their bank in person to terminate such services.", "tag-3": "\"The outcomes of the survey have reconfirmed for us the trend of recent years, where people increasingly arrange things online and, for example, call on banks in person much less,\" says Veronika \u0160pan\u00e1rov\u00e1, Retail Bank Head at Citi Czech Republic, adding: \"This is also one of the reasons why Citi's long-term strategy includes digitization and a focus on providing high-quality online services through both the internet and mobile banking.\"", "tag-4": "More than one half (52.8 percent) of the respondents have noted that they call on their bank's branch network less than once a month.", "tag-5": "Demand for mobile banking on the rise", "tag-6": "Citi's survey also gauged Czechs' awareness and use of mobile banking. As many as 84.2 percent of the respondents said they know the concept and one-quarter of them use mobile banking.", "tag-7": "Awareness and popularity of mobile banking is gradually rising in the Czech population. The survey conducted two years ago showed that 80 percent of the respondents knew the term mobile banking at that time, and so a slight increase is apparent here. \"According to the latest survey, 83.2 percent of the respondents also believe that mobile banking has benefits for users. In 2011, the figure was only 51.8 percent,\" adds Mrs. \u0160pan\u00e1rov\u00e1.", "tag-8": "Of the people who do not have mobile banking, only 14 percent have no confidence in the execution of banking operations through mobile phones and only 10 percent of the people are unable to handle this service. A surprising outcome is a few (less than 2 percent) respondents' claim that they do not use this service because of its high price. \"This finding is surprising for us because Citi provides mobile banking completely free of charge and concerns over the costs of using this service are unfounded,\" adds Mrs. \u0160pan\u00e1rov\u00e1.", "tag-9": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions. Citi provides consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, transaction services, and wealth management.", "tag-10": "Additional information may be found at www.citigroup.com | Twitter: @Citi | YouTube: www.youtube.com/citi | Blog: http://blog.citigroup.com | Facebook: www.facebook.com/citi | LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/citi"}
