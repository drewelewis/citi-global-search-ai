In this case, the paper and markers in the center of the room were ringed by a group of adults with a shared passion for supporting young people's college success. Bob Annibale, Citi's Global Director for Community Development and Microfinance, kicked things off by underscoring Citi's commitment to college success and welcoming the participants, who represented a mix of front-line college advisors and high school students, New York City educators, university administrators and researchers, and a host of community-based organizations.", "tag-4": "Then we heard a story. Dr. Michael Lomax, President and CEO of UNCF (United Negro College Fund), stepped into the circle and spun a powerful, largely personal tale that illustrated the current and historical inequities in college access. He laid down our charge for 2012: nothing less than to change the trajectory of our educational systems, which lets down too many students from low-income backgrounds. \"The solutions are here in the room,\" he said plainly. It was up to us to come up with ways to close the gaps in post-secondary educational access and success, which frequently mirror the income, race, gender and educational level of parents.", "tag-5": "We were energized and, markers in hand, we set to work. The conference used the Open Space Technology (OST) meeting model, developed in 1983, which works by enabling key stakeholders to create the agenda and run all the sessions. Every participant contributes actively. There's one overarching rule at OST meetings -- the \"law of two feet\": \"If you are neither learning, nor contributing, move on!\" This empowers participants to focus their engagement on the discussions that tap into their passion and willingness to take responsibility. With expert facilitation provided by Esther Matte and Joel Mausner, Ph.D., we held brainstorming sessions on the first day and developed correlating action plans on the second. The action plans are the responsibility of those who initiated them, but both CCD and the Options Center have pledged to support the groups with the logistics of their collaborations in the year ahead. We look forward to reporting on our progress!", "tag-6": "# # #", "tag-7": "About Goddard Riverside and Options", "tag-8": "Goddard Riverside is a community-based, multi-service agency located on the Upper West Side of Manhattan with roots in the settlement house movement. In addition to neighborhood-based services, it has created leading human service programs with borough- and city-wide reach. The mission of its pioneering Options Center is to increase the number of underrepresented young people who gain access to college and earn quality post-secondary degrees through Options' counseling, training, evaluation, advocacy, and dissemination of best practices.", "tag-9": "The Options Institute has a very high profile in the college access community. It maintains active communication with more than 1,000 individuals and 500 community-based organizations and schools in the New York City area which have participated in its offerings. The Institute also maintains strong relationships with New York City's school system."}
