We've heard firsthand from colleagues about the importance of seeing yourself in management and leadership, and as co-heads of Citi's Black Heritage Affinity, we're intensely focused on promoting and developing our existing Black talent.", "tag-4": "We often talk about the importance of 'owning your career' with the commitment that if you do, Citi will meet you more than half way. A new internal development program called 'Owning My Success' builds on this idea, where more than 50 mid-career Black colleagues will participate over the next three months in group coaching circles of 6-8 people alongside a professional coach and a senior Black executive at Citi. The program is designed to empower colleagues to chart their own career course and growth while strengthening their relationships with other talented colleagues across the firm.", "tag-5": "To build a foundation for this program, participants attended the Mid-Level Managers' Symposium (MLMS), a two-day professional development seminar for aspiring Black managers and executives to learn more about effective leadership and network. Held in Washington, D.C. on October 10 and 11, the event was hosted by the Executive Leadership Council (ELC), one of Citi's talent and diversity partners exclusively focused on supporting Black business leaders throughout the life cycle of their careers. The event brought together business leaders, academics, thought leaders, and development experts to share their perspectives on critical factors for long-term career success.", "tag-6": "For Citi, diversity and developing our talent are business imperatives. We're proud to offer this coaching program to a group of talented colleagues, and we are excited to continue to try new approaches and programs as we work to create a more diverse and inclusive workplace.", "tag-7": "Stephen Bird and Mark Mason are co-heads of Citi's Black Heritage Affinity.
