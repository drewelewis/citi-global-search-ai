We had strong growth in both loans and deposits, showed resilience in our markets-facing businesses, and saw record revenues in Transaction Services.

We remain focused on execution, managing our expenses and our risk, and serving clients as only we can.\"", "tag-6": "Citigroup revenues of $18.4 billion, excluding CVA/DVA, were 10% lower than the prior year period. Excluding both CVA/DVA and the loss on Akbank, Citigroup revenues were 7% below the prior year period.

Excluding CVA/DVA, Citicorp revenues were $17.8 billion, unchanged from the second quarter 2011. The results reflected a 2% decline in Securities and Banking revenues (excluding a positive CVA/DVA of $198 million) that was offset by a 5% increase in Transaction Services revenues, while Global Consumer Banking (GCB) revenues were unchanged versus second quarter 2011.", "tag-8": "Citi Holdings revenues of $924 million in the second quarter 2012 were 62% below the prior year period. Lower revenues in the Special Asset Pool and in Local Consumer Lending largely drove the decline in Citi Holdings revenues from the prior year period, partially offset by an increase in Brokerage and Asset Management revenues. The results in the Special Asset Pool and Local Consumer Lending largely reflected the ongoing decline in assets in these businesses as well as the absence of gains in the Special Asset Pool in the prior year period from the sale of securities that had been transferred from held-to-maturity and other asset sales.

Operating expenses of $12.1 billion were 6% lower than the prior year period.

Reserve releases in Citicorp of $715 million and in Citi Holdings of $269 million were 49% and 54% lower, respectively, than the second quarter 2011. Citicorp's decline in loan loss reserve releases reflected lower releases in North America GCB and Securities and Banking and a net credit reserve build in international GCB (Asia, Latin America and EMEA). The $314 million decline in Citi Holdings loan loss reserve releases was almost entirely due to the Special Asset Pool, where reserve releases declined $317 million from the second quarter 2011 to $83 million. Citigroup asset quality continued to improve as total non-accrual assets fell 22% to $11.5 billion compared to the second quarter 2011. Corporate non-accrual loans fell 47% to $2.6 billion and consumer non-accrual loans fell 1% to $8.3 billion.

The decrease largely reflected significantly lower net credit losses, which declined $736 million, or 25%, to $2.2 billion, which offset a $681 million, or 49%, reduction in loan loss reserve releases to $715 million, both compared to the second quarter 2011. The decline in reserve releases was largely in GCB.

Retail banking revenues grew 32% to $1.6 billion from the second quarter 2011, largely due to higher mortgage revenues. Citi-branded cards revenues declined 8% to $2.0 billion, and Citi retail services revenues declined 3% to $1.5 billion, both versus the prior year period. The lower results in cards primarily reflected lower average loan balances for both businesses as Citi-branded cards loans declined 3% and Citi retail services loans declined 4% from second quarter 2011, as well as lower yields.", "tag-20": "North America GCB net income was $1.2 billion, 8% higher than the second quarter 2011. The growth in net income was largely driven by the higher revenues and a $625 million decrease in net credit losses that was partially offset by a $427 million reduction in loan loss reserve releases versus the prior year period. Operating expenses in the second quarter grew 5% from the prior year period to $2.5 billion largely due to a legal reserve in the current quarter related to the interchange litigation.

Delinquency rates continued to improve in both Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services across all delinquency buckets versus the prior year period. Retail banking 90+ days delinquency rates increased versus the prior year period largely reflecting the impact of portfolio growth and seasoning, but nonetheless remained at historically low levels.
