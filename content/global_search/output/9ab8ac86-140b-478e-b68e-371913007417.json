Need to Know will travel to Oakland, California to report on the Family Independence Initiative, cited by the White House as a model program in which families meet monthly to set goals, advise each other, and track changes in income, assets, debts, health and education. The program gives families $30 for every goal achieved, up to $200 a month, and matches some of their savings. Among the first 86 families in the program, after two years, earnings were up 23% and savings 240%, 33% expanded a business or opened one, 17% bought new homes, people got promotions and raises, and a quarter of the families that had been receiving government income or housing subsidies dropped them.", "tag-4": "The Citi Foundation is focused on identifying and supporting innovative approaches to the most challenging issues around efforts to expand financial inclusion.
