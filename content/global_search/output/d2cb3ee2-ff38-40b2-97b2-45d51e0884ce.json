The cards referenced Citi's 200 years, and our commitment to our customers and communities. The cards also encouraged recipients to join us and \"pay it forward.\"", "tag-6": "On Global Community Day, I took my Pay It Forward cards, and paid for the person behind me in the drive-through window at a local restaurant. I've done this from time to time over the years, but it was fun to be able to leave a Pay It Forward card behind so the recipient would not only understand why they got a free meal, but also be encouraged to do something nice for someone else.", "tag-7": "I also spent time working with my local sailing and paddling club, providing a free sailing clinic for young people in the community. Our focus is to provide kids with an opportunity to have fun boating, while learning important life skills. Leadership, patience, teamwork, and self-confidence are among the skills most participants develop through the program. We worked with young people from all walks of life. Many came from underprivileged families and there were several with special needs, but out there on the water, none of that matters.", "tag-8": "We taught them how to rig and sail several types of sailboats, and spent a lot of time teaching boating safety. I've been doing this for many years, and it is one of my favorite volunteer activities. Not only do I get to spend time talking about something I really enjoy, but I love watching the young people grow in confidence as they take control of a boat for the first time. The experience empowers kids and they leave with a sense of accomplishment.", "tag-9": "How did the volunteering you did alongside the organization you worked with contribute to improving the community?", "tag-10": "Living in a lake community, I know that many of the kids in the area will eventually end up on the water, skippering their own boat, or tagging along with friends. I believe it is critical that they learn to do so safely. By offering free lessons, we're able to ensure that no one misses a chance to learn safety, regardless of their economic conditions. Ultimately, this helps ensure a safer environment on the lake for everyone, which is very important to our community. Additionally, we've found that the basic skills that come with sailing translate to leadership skills down the road. In the past few years, I've seen five kids who participated in our program go on to attend prestigious military academies. While we weren't the only factor in making these kids successful, we know we played a role.", "tag-11": "What are you most proud of from your volunteering experience?", "tag-12": "While I'm proud of the direct impact of my efforts, I'm even more proud of the extended impact that comes as I draw additional volunteers in to participate. I not only get to see how their efforts are making a difference in the lives of others, but I also get to see how those same efforts are affecting the volunteers themselves. There is a great sense of pride and satisfaction that comes from helping others, watching new volunteers enjoy that benefit is wonderful.", "tag-13": "What advice would you give to someone who wanted to start volunteering in their community?", "tag-14": "Find something important to you, and just dive in. There are countless ways you can volunteer, and so many organizations looking for people like you to help. I always stress to people that I'm not altruistic. I'm much more selfish than that, since I get just as much (if not more) out of my volunteering as I put in. Once you learn that, you'll find that volunteering is easy, and a great way to make a difference in the lives of others, as well as your own.", "tag-15": "What organization did you volunteer with on this year's Global Community Day?", "tag-16": "I volunteered with my local Sailing & Paddling Club again this year. I provided free sailing and kayaking lessons, including taking several kids on a moonlight paddling tour of a local lake."}
