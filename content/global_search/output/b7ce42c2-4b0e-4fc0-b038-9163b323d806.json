So, when we launched Action for Racial Equity in September 2020, we were very clear about the goals we wanted to achieve. Two years later, there's much to be proud of \u2013 we've not only met but exceeded our financial commitment of investing $1.1 billion in strategic initiatives. But we also need to be honest about how far we still have to go to embed racial equity into everything we do at Citi. This means changes to our external engagement and how we work with clients and customers, as well as changes internally and how we work with our colleagues. While our success is dependent on our strategy, it is equally contingent on the support and commitment of our leadership and holding ourselves accountable.", "tag-4": "The good news is that we have the wind at our backs. In addition to exceeding our financial goal ahead of schedule, we have made important progress over the past year including:", "tag-5": "We also recognize the importance of public-private partnerships to address systemic inequities. As such, Citi is a founding member of the Biden-Harris administration's Economic Opportunity Coalition, which aims to catalyze and align public and private investments. These investments will address economic disparities and accelerate economic opportunity in underserved communities in the U.S. Citi will support the coalition at large, with a focus on how it engages and strengthens community financial institutions, including community development financial institutions and MDIs.", "tag-6": "We know there's more work to do, and we must work collectively to take action within the firm and for the clients and communities we serve. I am honored to be part of a team that is committed to lasting change within Citi and beyond our walls, and I look forward to continuing this vital work for future generations."}
