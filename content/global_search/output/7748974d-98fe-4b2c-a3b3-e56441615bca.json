We\u2019re embedding ownership for diversity throughout our business...", "tag-3": "Holding ourselves to the highest standards means setting the tone from the top: our most senior leaders view themselves and others as accountable for enabling an equitable and inclusive culture; so, each Affinity is co-led by a member of the senior leadership team.", "tag-4": "Our nine Affinities include: Asian Heritage, Black Heritage, Citi Salutes\u00ae (Military Veterans), Citi Women\u00ae, Disability: Enabling Diverse Abilities, Generations, Hispanic/Latino Heritage, Parents and Pride (LGBTQ).

For managing director and director level hires, we continue to leverage diverse slates and panels, ensuring that women globally and/or racial and ethnic minorities in the U.S. are interviewed for our open roles and sit on the interview panels. These practices are important levers for us to ultimately achieve our goal of increasing representation of women and U.S. minorities.", "tag-9": "Pay Equity", "tag-10": "Pay equity is a very important principle at Citi. We have long had a number of efforts in place to help us adhere to that principle, including continuously evaluating market conditions to help inform pay and conducting a rigorous review of pay recommendations across the company as part of our annual compensation process each year.", "tag-11": "In recent years, we\u2019ve expanded on those efforts to assess pay at Citi when comparing women to men, and U.S. minorities to non-minorities. As a starting point, this analysis was conducted in the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany, and we accounted for a number of factors in our analysis to make the comparisons meaningful, including job function, level and geography. We found that women are paid on average 99% of what men are paid, and minorities are paid on average 99% of what non-minorities are paid.", "tag-12": "During compensation cycles, we are making appropriate increases to help close the gaps for both women and U.S. minorities. We will also continue to adjust compensation for other individuals where the analysis determined increases are warranted. We are committed to continuing to review compensation for pay equity and will continue this analysis in all other countries where we have employees.", "tag-13": "Pay equity is an issue that is rightly receiving a great deal of attention and scrutiny. Data and research consistently point to a pay gap among men and women, and minorities and non-minorities employees, across industries. At Citi, our continuing focus on pay equity furthers our goal of being the employer of choice for employees of diverse backgrounds, and it supports our efforts to attract and retain the best talent and reward performance consistent with our Leadership Standards. These are clear business imperatives for Citi, and we remain firmly committed to them.", "tag-14": "Unconscious Bias Training", "tag-15": "A critical aspect to building the right culture is addressing unconscious bias in the workplace, which is an area where we continue to invest and focus. We developed and launched a training that enables participants to understand the business case for an inclusive work environment, recognize unconscious bias and take actions to improve on-the-job decision making to support Citi's culture of leaderships, ethics and inclusion.", "tag-16": "How We Work", "tag-17": "Citi proudly embraces a culture of flexible work.

We continue to focus enhancing our employee learning and development opportunities shifting to more flexible, cloud-based solutions. These digital platforms enable learning when, where and how it is most effective for employees. We also offer a range of internal development programs for leaders at all levels, and we continue to evolve those programs to meet new needs.", "tag-20": "Some of our development programs include:", "tag-21": "Across Asia Pacific, and in partnership with Ernst & Young, we launched a new program called ASCENT focused on providing Senior Vice Presidents with the sponsorship and growth opportunities that are critical for career progression."}
