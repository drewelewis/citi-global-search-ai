Is it too late to invest in gold? Will emerging markets bounce back? These are the sort of questions we ask, especially at times like this, when the markets' direction seems so uncertain.", "tag-3": "But there are two big problems. First, these questions are mighty tough to answer, because it means peering into an extremely cloudy crystal ball. Second, such questions suggest we're too focused on buying the \"right\" investments and we may be missing the big picture.", "tag-4": "What to do? Try taking a step back--and focusing on your asset allocation, which is your portfolio's basic mix of stocks, bonds, cash investments and alternative investments. Cash investments include things like savings accounts and Treasury bills, while the alternative-investments category can encompass a variety of investments, including real estate, gold, commodities and hedge funds.", "tag-5": "Your basic asset mix will likely be a key driver of a portfolio's risk and return. The more you invest in stocks, the higher your potential long-run return--but also the greater the chance you will suffer severe losses.", "tag-6": "Indeed, your asset allocation will probably have a far bigger impact on your returns than the individual investments you select. For instance, in a rising stock market, someone who is heavily invested in stock-market investments--even ones that prove to be mediocre performers--will likely fare better than another investor who is mostly in certificates of deposit, no matter how carefully selected those CDs are. Conversely, when the stock market tumbles, folks who are largely invested in stocks--even supposedly conservative stocks--will probably lose far more than those who stick mostly with CDs.", "tag-7": "INVESTMENT PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022 NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-8": "The information provided is solely for informational purposes.

Investments in alternative assets (e.g., hedge funds, private equity) are speculative, not suitable for all clients, and intended for experienced and sophisticated investors who are willing to bear the high economic risks of the investment, which can include: loss of all or a substantial portion of the capital invested due to leveraging, short-selling or other speculative investment practices; lack of liquidity in that there may be no secondary market for the Portfolio and none expected to develop; volatility of returns; restrictions on transferring shares/interests in the Portfolio; absence of information regarding valuations and pricing; lack of diversification and concentration of risk due to a single manager delays in tax reporting; less regulation and higher fees than mutual funds; and advisor risk.", "tag-11": "CDs maturing on or before December 31, 2013, are insured by the FDIC up to $250,000. Through December 31, 2013, FDIC insurance has been increased to $250,000 for all ownership categories, principal and interest combined, per depositor, per institution, for all deposits held in each insurable capacity. Unless otherwise extended, insurance coverage will revert to the $100,000 limit on January 1, 2014, except for IRAs and certain self-directed retirement accounts which will remain at $250,000. Any CD with a maturity date after December 31, 2014, will be FDIC insured only for $100,000 principal and interest combined. Please consult a Financial Advisor to discuss how to manage the amount of funds invested in CDs while maintaining complete FDIC insurance coverage.
