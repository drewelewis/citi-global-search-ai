Since the beginning of 2012, Citigroup has retired approximately US$22.7 billion of senior debt, subordinated debt, preferred and trust preferred securities, reducing Citigroup's overall funding costs and efficiently deploying its ample liquidity. Citigroup will continue to consider opportunities to redeem or repurchase securities, based on several factors, including without limitation, the economic value, potential impact on Citigroup's net interest margin and borrowing costs, the overall remaining tenor of Citigroup's debt portfolio, as well as overall market conditions.", "tag-4": "The following table sets forth the Notes that are subject to the Offers as well as the aggregate principal amounts of Notes that were validly tendered and not validly withdrawn prior to 5 p.m., New York City time, on May 30, 2013 (the \"Early Tender Date\").", "tag-5": "View full press release with table.", "tag-6": "The Offers are being made pursuant to the offer to purchase dated May 16, 2013 (as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the \"Offer to Purchase\"), and the related letters of transmittal (as may be amended or supplemented from time to time, the \"Letters of Transmittal\") which set forth in more detail the terms and conditions of the Offers.
