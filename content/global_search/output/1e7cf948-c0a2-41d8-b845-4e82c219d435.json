Citi\u00ae Global Collect, a collaboration between Citi's Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) and Foreign Exchange (FX) businesses, will help multinational clients continue to extend their global reach, making it easier to collect funds from overseas payers and apply cash faster. In today's environment, institutions deal with multiple service providers to collect their payments by presenting invoices, collecting funds cross-border and reconciling payments-creating an inefficient and disjointed experience. Additionally, current collection processes are primarily manual and paper-based, creating more operational inefficiency.", "tag-1": "Citi Helps Clients Collect Cross-Border B2B Payments with a New Platform, Citi\u00ae Global Collect", "tag-2": "New York \u2013 Citi has launched a new cross-border platform to help its multinational clients manage the complexities in collecting cross border business-to-business payments, by digitizing the transaction process and embedding FX capabilities.
