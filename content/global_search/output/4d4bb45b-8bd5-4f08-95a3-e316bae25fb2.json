As we have pointed out for several years, the survey has demonstrated a very consistent lead on corporate investment in human, physical and working capital and argues that investors should expect further gains in jobs, capital investment and industrial production this year though some moderation in pace seems likely as well. In this context, as production climbs so should earnings given historical relationships even as peak EPS fears persist.", "tag-4": "US recession fears seem unwarranted especially in the face of small business hiring intentions. As noted, the survey supports continued employment expansion over the course of the year and this notion is confirmed by the National Federation of Independent Business' poll of small business hiring intentions which lead unemployment rates by 12 months. While month-to-month volatility can be expected especially due to seasonality, recession forecasts appear misguided barring exogenous shocks."}
