We had to suspend account updates due to some server maintenance last weekend. We apologize for that inconvenience. We restored connectivity on Wednesday, April 18th.", "tag-6": "We hear you loud and clear that you want more from your rewards Cards and we are working on it. I wanted to share some changes we made that improve the value and the flexibility when you redeem. We improved the value of our most popular redemption items. You can get merchandise, $25 and $50 gift cards, and more for fewer points than before. You can get reward items from Best Buy\u00ae in minutes with in-store pick up at your local Best Buy\u00ae stores or get rewards instantly with Amazon\u00ae eCodes and Fandango\u00ae and Zappos\u00ae eGift Cards. Plus, redeeming for air travel is now possible even when you don't have enough points, you can pay the difference with your Citi Card when you book through the Thank You Travel Center. Much more to come and we will keep you posted.", "tag-7": "Some of you mentioned you would like to avoid foreign transaction fees on purchases. We have three cards that don't charge foreign transaction fees -- the Citi ThankYouSM Premier Card, Citi ThankYouSM Prestige Card, and the Citi ExecutiveSM / AAdvantage\u00ae World EliteTM MasterCard\u00ae. We encourage you to follow the links and explore the other great benefits and features of these cards as well.", "tag-8": "We remain committed to delivering the products, rewards and service you deserve.
