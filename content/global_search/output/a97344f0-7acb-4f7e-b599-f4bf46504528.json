Calvert Foundation is capitalizing the initiative with donations as well as investments raised from the private sector.", "tag-5": "\"Investment in the ingenuity and ambition of women is critical if we hope to have any success as a more equitable global society,\" said Citi CEO Vikram Pandit. \"Expanding financial inclusion and fostering innovation are both central to Citi's mission, and the WIN-WIN program embodies both of these core commitments. The Citi Foundation's support of this cutting-edge Calvert Foundation initiative will provide critical financing with the power to advance economic opportunity for underserved women around the world.\"", "tag-6": "The World Bank calls investing in women 'smart economics' because research shows economic growth for women has an important multiplier effect. Women reinvest \u2013 they spend more earned income on food, healthcare, home improvement, and schooling for themselves and their children than their male counterparts. Further, projections show that reducing the financial barriers to entry for female labor force participation could drastically increase national productivity in developed countries.", "tag-7": "\"Because women are more likely to share their economic gains with their families and communities at large, we are excited to create a portfolio dedicated to helping women succeed,\" said Lisa Hall, President and CEO of Calvert Foundation. \"And we are so glad to have the Citi Foundation share this vision of women's economic empowerment and opportunity with us.\"", "tag-8": "\"We are excited to support WIN-WIN because it provides the platform for women to become agents of their own economic power and opportunity,\" said Pamela Flaherty, President and CEO of the Citi Foundation. \"WIN-WIN is an innovative model for financial inclusion that sources and directs capital in new ways to improve the lives of women, their families and their communities.\"", "tag-9": "WIN-WIN will support women like Jane Skeeter, founder of UltraGlas Inc. Jane has run her own business for nearly 40 years, in an industry typically dominated by men. Like many entrepreneurs, Jane's business has faced numerous challenges, yet her history and growth potential convinced Calvert Foundation borrower and Los Angeles-based CDFI Valley Economic Development Center (VEDC) to provide her with a loan to purchase equipment that has increased production while using less power. More importantly, Jane's success means she is poised to create 65 more jobs before 2014.", "tag-10": "MFIs and CDFIs like VEDC fill a critical financing gap for entrepreneurs that cannot access traditional sources due to short credit history or an impractically small loan request, sometimes as low as $1,000. WIN-WIN will make it possible for these organizations to support more women worldwide. In addition to lending in the U.S., WIN-WIN will lend approximately 25% of the fund internationally.", "tag-11": "WIN-WIN also makes use of a strategy to not only leverage private sector capital to improve the lives of women, but also seeks to mobilize women investors as lead providers of capital to the fund. Women comprise nearly half of the nation's top wealth holders and control $20 trillion in spending globally. WIN-WIN specifically seeks to attract women's investment capital and its huge potential to transform the lives of women around the world.", "tag-12": "WIN-WIN is the latest instance of Citi supporting Calvert Foundation's efforts to expand opportunity for underserved populations. The organizations previously collaborated in 2010 on the launch of the Communities at Work Fund, which has since invested more than $100 million to create jobs and improve communities in the U.S.", "tag-13": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
