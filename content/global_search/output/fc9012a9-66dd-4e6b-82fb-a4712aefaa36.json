Inserting the card into a chip-enabled terminal activates a secure authentication process. The embedded microchip encrypts cardmember information into a unique code that is checked for validity even before the transaction is transmitted. The code protects data as it travels through the payment system to the server that authenticates and validates the information before authorizing the transaction based on card status (credit limit, blocks and other factors verified during this process).", "tag-4": "Marcelo Gorrini, General Manager of Citi Costa Rica, emphasized that Citi aims to be the best financial option for its clients. \"Being the first bank in the country to offer chip cards is a demonstration of the priority we place on innovation, service and security to be the best financial option for our clients. We released the Delta Skymiles chip card in March, and we will be launching other products incorporating the new technology this month. The new cards allow our clients to make their purchases more secure here or anywhere in the world, especially in markets that have largely transitioned away from the magnetic strip (in Europe, for example). As we issue new cards and renew or maintain existing accounts, we will progressively transition to the new chip cards over the course of this year,\" Gorrini added.", "tag-5": "Clients will benefit first from the chip technology in their international purchases. In Costa Rica, the benefits will spread gradually as chip-enabled Points of Service (POS) are introduced. Throughout this process, Citi clients will be able to use their new cards at establishments with POS that have not yet activated the new technology.", "tag-6": "For more information or to order a chip card, please call 506 22399019.", "tag-7": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
