The savings rate subsided in the late 1980s and fell off rapidly after 1992, hitting a low of 1.5% in 2005.", "tag-6": "Unnerved by the Great Recession, Americans have started saving more. Still, 2011's savings rate was just 4.7%, well below what we saw for much of the post-World War II period.", "tag-7": "Arguably, in the short-term, it might be helpful for Americans to spend more, rather than save, as we look to spur the economic recovery.
