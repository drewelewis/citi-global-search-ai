Citi's program officers work in collaboration with global and U.S.-based financial education and asset building organizations to develop programs that help people develop the skills they need to make informed financial decisions, and acquire and preserve assets over the course of their lives. As Flaherty noted in accepting the Leadership in Philanthropy award, such collaborations, with AIF and others, are key in helping Citi Foundation \"design and test financial inclusion innovations with potential to achieve scale and significant impact.\"", "tag-4": "For its part, AIF works with Indian non-governmental organizations (NGOs) focused on primary education, livelihood and public health initiatives. Recent examples of its work include Rickshaw Sangh, a program that helps rickshaw drivers develop sustainable independent businesses for themselves, and Digital Equalizer, which brings technology to under-resourced schools across India."}
