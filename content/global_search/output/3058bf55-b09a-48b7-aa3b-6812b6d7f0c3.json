The third place and three stars were also won by Citi Handlowy in Forbes' \"Best Banks for Small and Medium Enterprises.\"", "tag-3": "Newsweek's rankings are based on results from a mystery-shopper survey conducted by Millward Brown SMG/KRC. Banks are evaluated in three categories: friendly bank for traditional customers, online banking and mobile banking customers. To win a spot in the traditional banking category, a bank has to achieve the highest possible grades for service quality (knowledge and competences of bank's employees, discretion of the employees during the visit), characteristic features of an outlet (including, for example, parking in the vicinity of the outlet, cleanliness, disabled access), methods of acquiring and retaining the client and ability to identify their needs and provide them with the most suitable offer.", "tag-4": "Slawomir S. Sikora, President of Citi Handlowy, said: \"This award is doubly satisfying to us. First, it coincides with Citi's 200th anniversary and Bank Handlowy's 140th anniversary. Second, it is an important signal that taking up strategy based on quality, innovativeness and transparency was a very good step. We did it three years ago. We were the first to do it, and now it is apparent that customers appreciate it, which is reflected in the bank's results and the price of our shares at the stock exchange. We have an excellent team. I hope we will take the first place next year.\"", "tag-5": "The ranking of Forbes magazine is based on commonly accessible data, such as banks' price lists and the information about the offer of services and financial products for companies.
