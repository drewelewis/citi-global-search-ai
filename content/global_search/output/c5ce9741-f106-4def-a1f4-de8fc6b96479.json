The bank's state charter allowed it to do business anywhere except Connecticut. The founding president was Marcellus Hartley, owner of the Remington Arms Co. Other directors included corporate lawyer Thomas Hubbard, investment bankers Jules Bache and William Salomon, along with representatives of the Equitable and Metropolitan insurance companies. Hubbard, who had previously worked as financial officer for Southern Pacific Railway, assumed the presidency following Marcellus Hartley's death in early 1902. After opening a branch in London in April 1902, IBC established branches in rapid succession in Shanghai, Singapore, Manila, Yokohama, and Hong Kong. It also hired two traders from Deutsche Bank to develop its foreign exchange business in New York. By 1904, the Asian network had spread to Calcutta and Bombay, Kobe, Guangzhou, and Cebu. Additional branches were established in the Chinese cities of Beijing and Hankou in 1909. More followed in 1918 (Java, today part of Indonesia) and 1919 (Burma and China), and others later in China and Japan. IBC was a commercial bank. A large part of its success in China rested on maintaining a close relationship with multinationals operating in China, such as American Trading, Shanghai Telephone, Standard Oil, and British American Tobacco. It received the US government's special encouragement and support, which allowed it to broaden its branch network in the region and begin expanding its business. IBC's business originated with the local subsidiaries of the bank's corporate clients, rather than with their U.S. headquarters. Much of IBC's business was trade-related, such as financing exports of raw silk and tea from China and Japan, cotton and jute from India, and tin and rubber from Singapore. From the Philippines came exports of hemp, copra, sugar, tobacco, and coconut oil. IBC was also involved in the import trade, financing Chinese imports of silver from the United States as well as Japanese imports of cotton from India and wool from Australia. The 19th century had seen a flow of Chinese immigrants to the United States. They worked on the construction of the railroads, and they were a source of labor for agriculture and many industries. Their remittances were an important source of foreign exchange for China, and many of them flowed through the IBC branch in San Francisco. In 1915 National City Bank acquired a majority interest in IBC and fully acquired the company in 1919."}
