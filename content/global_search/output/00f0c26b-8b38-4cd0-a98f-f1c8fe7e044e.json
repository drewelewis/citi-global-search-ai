I was able to buy the material I needed\u2014microfiber and lycra, both imported\u2014and increase our monthly production,\" she explained. \"This made it possible for me to help more women that need this product, many of whom live in far-flung corners of the country.\"", "tag-6": "When Stanila first started the business, she produced between 15 and 25 prostheses a month. Thanks to the award and the media exposure it gave her, she expanded her client portfolio and now has a monthly production capacity of 50 to 80 bras and prostheses. In addition to the products she sells, she has held four charitable promotions and donated bras to more than 400 women with mastectomies.", "tag-7": "\"The Citi Award opened more doors for me to publicize this amazing venture, and it has served as an endorsement for new partnerships. Participating in the awards program was an excellent opportunity and has helped me be an inspiration for other women, especially those with mastectomies,\" Stanila declared. \"I am proof that if you have the will and the drive, everything is possible.\"", "tag-8": "The Citi Microentrepreneurship Awards are an annual recognition offered by Citibank Venezuela and the Citi Foundation, with the support of the NGO Centro Lyra, to motivate people with new ideas to contribute to the well-being of society.", "tag-9": "\"It started as a way to help myself\"  Stanila was working in a sewing shop when she first noticed the lump on her breast, but she didn't pay it much mind at first. When it became more pronounced, she decided to go to the doctor for a mammogram, and a biopsy confirmed that she had cancer in her left breast. This was back in January 2010. Fueled by the will to live and full of hope, she began chemotherapy, followed by a mastectomy and, later, radiation.", "tag-10": "\"I decided not to have breast reconstruction surgery, so after the mastectomy I used to stuff a rolled-up rag inside my bra. I felt bad every time I did it, and that was when my friends at work started to invent things that could help,\" Stanila recalled. \"We pooled our knowledge and experience to make a bra pad in the shape of a breast, and that led to the creation of the external prosthesis.", "tag-11": "\"The project helped me find joy in life again, and I began to see that it could help other women who have gone through the same thing. That led us to look for funding to hold an annual donation drive for low-income women who could benefit from our product,\" she explained.", "tag-12": "In addition to brassieres, Stanila produces attractive bathing suit tops for women with mastectomies in prints and styles to suit every figure, carefully designed to disguise imperfections.", "tag-13": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
