She understands how transformative - and expensive - Paralympic sport can be and has chosen to support the Team USA Paralympic Champions Fund to make Paralympic sport more accessible. <br><br><strong>Q: You've faced many tough moments throughout your life. How did adversity shape the way you approach sports and life? </strong> <br><br>A: I was a hopeful seventeen year old, ready to take over the world, when I broke my back in a snowboarding accident. As an athlete, becoming paralyzed was absolutely one of the hardest thing I could have imagined happening to me. I always identified myself as an athlete, but I did not think that it would be possible after my accident. It was not until I was fortunate enough to be introduced to wheelchair basketball that I found myself again and became the athlete I always was. Losing my brother was another hard thing I had to deal with. Having that loss overtake me right before the Vancouver 2010 Paralympic Winter Games, I thought that I wasn't going to be able to perform. But with the support of my family, I was able to turn his loss into my inspiration and win for him. <br><br><strong>Q: How did you manage to stay so positive through the tough times? Have you always had this positive outlook? <br></strong> <br>A: I wouldn't say I've always had a positive outlook. Anybody that is put in a tough position is given a choice. You have to decide whether you are going to sink or swim and for me it just seems so black and white - I could dig myself a hole or I could feel the pain and then move on. Knowing this helped me have a positive outlook and attitude. <br><strong><br>Q: Why is Paralympic sport so important for people with physical disabilities? </strong> <br><br>A: Paralympic sport is life-changing for some individuals with disabilities. From a personal perspective, I thought my life was over after my accident, but I was given a whole new breath of life when I learned about Paralympic sport programs. And for other people with disabilities, it gives them confidence and hope for their future. Without Paralympic sport programs, people with disabilities aren't given the same opportunity to be the best athletes that they can be, and it's incredibly important to have them. <br><strong><br>Q: What are some of the financial challenges faced by Paralympic athletes? </strong> <br><br>A: Without the same media coverage as able-bodied candidates, sponsorship is not as accessible for us. So many Paralympic athletes are often left working full-time jobs, and some of us have families to support. They literally have to quit doing the sport that they love because they can't afford it, and that's one of the most disappointing things. <br><br>The Team USA Paralympic Champions Fund was put into place by U.S. Paralympics to support elite-level athletes and their journey to the Paralympic Games. I'm really excited to be a part of Citi's Every Step of Way program to help future Paralympians compete at the highest level. <br><a href=\"https://everystep.citi.com/#alana\"><br>Learn more</a> about how you can support Alana and the Team USA Paralympic Champions Fund.", "tag-1": "Q&A with Team Citi Member Alana Nichols: New Found Life with Paralympic Sport", "tag-2": "Join us as we profile nine Team Citi athletes on the Citi Blog as part of our Every Step of the Way program.
