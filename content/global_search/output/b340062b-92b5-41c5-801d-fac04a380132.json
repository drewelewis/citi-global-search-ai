He currently serves as the Chief Marketing Officer of the Salesforce Marketing Cloud. Michael and wife Kass founded Buddy Media in 2007, which pioneered a new category of software-as-a-service - the social media management suite - that became a must buy for the world's largest brands and agencies. Before Buddy Media, Michael founded Student Advantage, University Wire, Lazerow Consulting and GOLF.com, which was purchased by Time Warner's Time Inc. in January 2006.", "tag-4": "Visit the City of the Year website to vote for Medell\u00edn, Tel Aviv, or New York City.", "tag-5": "Q: Why do you think New York City should be chosen for 'City of the Year'?", "tag-6": "It's hard to list the accomplishments of a city like New York in one blog post; you'd need an edition of the Encyclopedia Britannica for that. But the number of success stories in the city is remarkable, from Foursquare to Tumblr to Buddy Media to BuzzFeed, and that's just in the tech space (take a look at the Made In NY Digital Map to see just how many companies exist in our city). It all starts from the top with Mayor Bloomberg, who is consistently working to make New York the place that businesses, especially in the tech space, can thrive. It's a city that has produced some incredible companies and incredible leaders, and which has faced a horrific hurricane and has worked together, both on an individual level and at a corporate level (the outpouring of support for the areas hit hardest from New York companies is nothing short of remarkable). I think it'd be crazy to put another city above New York when it comes to accomplishments and innovation.", "tag-7": "Q: What is the best way you think cities can encourage innovators?", "tag-8": "I think the best thing cities can do to encourage innovators is to connect people. In a city like New York where there are millions of people and thousands of businesses, it can be overwhelming to try to network with the right people. Cities have access to all of this information, and can facilitate connections through targeted events that bring together people who can mutually benefit from discourse.", "tag-9": "Q: How do you think New York City contributes to innovation?", "tag-10": "In New York City, you're always rubbing elbows with people - literally. Whether you're on the subway, sitting six inches from another table at a restaurant, you overhear conversations, and can pull inspiration from any block in the city. I think this shared feeling of \"we're all in this together\" carries over to the workplace as well. The offices in New York are collaborative, open-air and oozing with creativity. If you live in New York City, you have to continue to innovate - in all aspects of your life, from your apartment to your fashion to your business, just to stay EVEN with the rest of the city. Things move at a whirlwind pace, and there's no doubt in my mind that the competitive nature of the city bleeds into the way we work.", "tag-11": "Q: What is your greatest source of inspiration?", "tag-12": "My inspiration has come from a number of places throughout my life, from my mom who was a public interest lobbyist, to my dad who owned a home inspection company, to my stepfather who had one job his entire life, to my mentor, Doug Bailey, who started political publications where I interned and learned what it meant to work hard. But my greatest inspiration comes from my wife, Kass, whose incredible wisdom, work ethic and compassion has helped me both start successful businesses and raise an incredible family, all the while reminding me how important it is to give back to our community and causes that we both care deeply about, such as Cycle for Survival and charity:water.", "tag-13": "Q: How important do you think community is for innovation?", "tag-14": "Community may be the single most important factor in innovation. Innovation is rarely something that moves from the inside-out; instead, I think it comes from a community and works its way within a work environment. There are savants out there with great ideas, but even Apple's products, while credited to Steve Jobs, were the result of a community full of ideas- just look at the ideas that stemmed from his visits to Xerox. Communities can take a number of different shapes - physical surroundings, neighbors, online communities, etc. By using the resources provided by these communities, be it through office space, human capital or online forums, you can begin to grasp the ways in which you can make your product, and ultimately your business, more innovative and successful.", "tag-15": "For more information on Citi and WSJ's City of the Year competition and to vote for Medell\u00edn, Tel Aviv, or New York City, click here."}
