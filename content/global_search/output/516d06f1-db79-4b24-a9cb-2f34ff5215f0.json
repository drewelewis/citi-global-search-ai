The Citi Foundation's grant will be used to build capacity in the community and establish revolving funds in the target villages, where farmers will get access to capital to increase production and support income generating activities. The program will also increase the self-confidence and interactivity among farmers through teaching farmers to support each other in community based Farmers' Clubs.", "tag-9": "Michael Hermann, country representative for HPP China, said, \"HPP China engages in the concrete struggle of poverty side by side with the impoverished people.
