Last month, we made our own commitment to achieve net zero emissions by 2050, which includes emissions associated with our financing as well as achieving net zero for our own operations by 2030. We recognize this will require collaboration and engagement across our entire firm and our clients, and we are developing a plan over the course of the year for how we intend to accomplish this ambition.", "tag-6": "To build on this commitment, yesterday, Citi became a founding signatory of the Net Zero Banking Alliance (NZBA), a global alliance of 43 banks across 23 countries convened by the United Nations Environment Programme Finance Initiative, working to achieve net zero by 2050. NZBA establishes a common industry framework and guidelines for banking net zero commitments and will help guide us in our net zero journey.", "tag-7": "The best time to act is now", "tag-8": "If the pandemic taught us one thing, it is that we don't have a moment to lose when it comes to addressing a crisis.

This commitment includes extending our $250 Billion Environmental Finance Goal to $500 billion by 2030, as well as an additional $500 billion target to finance other important activities that advance the UN's Sustainable Development Goals.", "tag-10": "Understanding that environmental and social wellbeing are closely connected, we're continuing to look at environmental justice as a human rights risk in our environmental and social risk management policies and conducting enhanced due diligence on our client activities and projects as part of Citi's Environmental and Social Risk Management Policy. Additional highlights of our work from the past year include:", "tag-11": "As the world begins to emerge from COVID-19, we know that we cannot go back to business-as-usual. On this Earth Day, we pledge to take the lessons we've learned over the last year and extend our efforts to build a more sustainable future."}
