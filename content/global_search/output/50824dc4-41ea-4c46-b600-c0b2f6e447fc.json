To address this need, the Citi Foundation joined a small group of funders and practitioners to collaborate with the Success Measures program (<a href=\"https://www.successmeasures.org\">www.successmeasures.org</a>) at NeighborWorks America to develop and field test a comprehensive set of financial capability outcome indicators and data collection instruments. The Success Measures Financial Capability Indicators and Tools will make it easier for practitioners to measure changes in low- and moderate-income consumers' financial status, attitudes, behaviors, resilience and more, free of charge.", "tag-1": "Evaluation in Action: Demonstrating Results, Measuring Impact and Informing Change in Financial Capability", "tag-2": "The financial capability field is always looking for better, more rigorous ways to demonstrate results of financial coaching, financial education, housing, credit counseling and asset building efforts on the lives of individuals and families.

Data collected from The Success Measures Financial Capability Indicators and Tools can be tailored by community-based organizations to conduct structured conversations with clients on financial issues, inform changes in program design, and communicate results to a wide range of stakeholders. Financial capability funders, researchers and policy makers can analyze client data across multiple organizations working toward the same outcomes with the same set of shared, tested metrics to identify best practice, improve their understanding of factors that impact financial stability and promote innovation through public policy reform.", "tag-4": "This collaborative field-building effort has already gained considerable traction. For example, the Youth Financial Empowerment (YFE) program in New York City has used the new tools to determine attitudes and behaviors regarding financial practices of youth in its program and is continuing to track changes over time. This will enable YFE to better help its clients cultivate a mind-set about saving money that would support the transition from foster care to independence. In Oakland, the East Bay Asian Local Development Corporation (EBALDC) has been able to make use of the tools to help its clients begin to learn how to reduce their debt, while also beginning to accumulate savings.", "tag-5": "To sustain the momentum of these, and similar efforts, a two-year $5 million grant from the Citi Foundation is supporting a scaling initiative aimed at delivering state of the art financial education and coaching needed to enable families to build their savings, reduce debt and better manage their finances. As an important component of the initiative, thirty-one organizations are receiving training and technical assistance to use the Success Measures Financial Capability tools to conduct real-time evaluations of how the financial knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of their clients change over time.", "tag-6": "We welcome your feedback on these new financial capability outcome evaluation tools and look forward to learning how practitioners are using them in their asset building work. Check out the tools in the Citi-funded publication:", "tag-7": "Measuring Outcomes of Financial Capability Programs: Success Measures Tools for Practitioners is available as a fully indexed and bookmarked PDF for free online download at www.successmeasures.org/fctools.html"}
