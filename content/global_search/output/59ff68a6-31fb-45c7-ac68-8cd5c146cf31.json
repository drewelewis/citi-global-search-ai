Today, Citi signed the Human Rights Campaign's Business Statement Opposing Anti-LGBTQ+ State Legislation, reiterating our belief all people have a fundamental right to equality and opposing harmful legislation aimed at restricting the access of LGBTQ+ people in society.", "tag-3": "In 2021, there has been an alarming rise in bills proposed, and passed, at the state level that would single out LGBTQ+ individuals \u2013 many specifically targeting transgender youth \u2013 for exclusion or differential treatment. Legislation promoting discrimination has the potential to impact our colleagues and their families, our clients, customers and our business in a negative way. Instead of joining the efforts towards full equality and inclusion for the LGBTQ+ community, these laws target already marginalized groups, including children, for additional disadvantage.", "tag-4": "In contrast to discriminatory proposals we've seen, we are encouraged to see other areas posting significant progress toward equality and inclusion for the LGBTQ+ community this year. Just this week, federal protections were reinstated to defend transgender people against discrimination in healthcare. In February, as the Equality Act passed the House of Representatives, Citi reaffirmed our support for the landmark legislation, which would provide the same basic protections to LGBTQ+ people as are provided to other protected groups under federal law. Citi has been supportive of the Equality Act since 2019, when it was first introduced as a definitive vehicle amending existing laws such as the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Fair Housing Act, the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, and the Jury Selection and Services Act, among others.", "tag-5": "We will continue to support positive change fostering a diverse and inclusive environment. We remain steadfast in our commitment to equality and protections for transgender people and all members of the LGBTQ+ community at Citi."}
