Before trying to come up with an answer, however, you need to know how much you currently have in bonds and other income-producing investments. The tricky part: What counts as a bond?", "tag-4": "Perhaps the best place to start is by looking at your current asset allocation. This is your portfolio's split between stocks and less aggressive holdings, such as bonds, certificates of deposit and other investments that can generate income.", "tag-5": "But here's where things get a little messy: When looking at how much you have in income investments, don't just focus on how much you have in bonds, CDs and other income-producing investments. There may, in fact, be other parts of your financial life that bear a striking resemblance to bonds.", "tag-6": "For instance, you might view your paycheck as being similar to a bond, especially if your job is secure and your pay doesn't fluctuate much from month to month. To diversify this \"bond,\" you might invest more heavily in stocks, especially if you are relatively young and have decades of paychecks ahead of you.", "tag-7": "Similarly, in retirement, you might think of your Social Security benefit and any pension you're entitled to as comparable to a big bond investment. If these sources of regular income cover much of your living costs, that may free you up to take a little more risk with your investment portfolio.", "tag-8": "On the other hand, you may discover you have less invested in bonds than you had imagined. For example, your debts might be seen as \"negative bonds,\" because--instead of receiving interest--you're paying interest to others. Indeed, if you have $150,000 in bonds but also a $100,000 mortgage, arguably your net bond position is just $50,000 and your finances may be riskier than your big bond position suggests.", "tag-9": "PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022 NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-10": "The information provided is solely for informational purposes. It is not an offer to buy or sell any of the securities, insurance products, investments, or other products named.", "tag-11": "Diversification does not guarantee a profit or protect against a loss.", "tag-12": "Bonds are affected by a number of risks, including fluctuations in interest rates, credit risk and prepayment risk. In general, as prevailing interest rates rise, fixed income securities prices will fall. Bonds face credit risk if a decline in an issuer's credit rating, or creditworthiness, causes a bond's price to decline. High yield bonds are subject to additional risks such as increased risk of default and greater volatility because of the lower credit quality of the issues. Finally, bonds can be subject to prepayment risk. When interest rates fall, an issuer may choose to borrow money at a lower interest rate, while paying off its previously issued bonds. As a consequence, underlying bonds will lose the interest payments from the investment and will be forced to reinvest in a market where prevailing interest rates are lower than when the initial investment was made.", "tag-13": "CDs maturing on or before December 31, 2013, are insured by the FDIC up to $250,000. Through December 31, 2013, FDIC insurance has been increased to $250,000 for all ownership categories, principal and interest combined, per depositor, per institution, for all deposits held in each insurable capacity. Unless otherwise extended, insurance coverage will revert to the $100,000 limit on January 1, 2014, except for IRAs and certain self-directed retirement accounts which will remain at $250,000. Any CD with a maturity date after December 31, 2014, will be FDIC insured only for $100,000 principal and interest combined. Please consult a Financial Advisor to discuss how to manage the amount of funds invested in CDs while maintaining complete FDIC insurance coverage.
