Teach a man to fish, and you've fed him for a lifetime.\" It's a common quote that we've all heard before, but did Confucius really say it first?", "tag-1": "Meet YEC's Jason Nazar of Docstoc.com on #StartupLab", "tag-2": "\"Give a man a fish, and you'll feed him for a day. Teach a man to fish, and you've fed him for a lifetime.\" It's a common quote that we've all heard before, but did Confucius really say it first?", "tag-3": "Regardless of who first mouthed the maxim, it's Jason Nazar who embodies these words when it comes to entrepreneurship. He co-founded Docstoc.com, the online documents site for starting new businesses, only a month after debuting at 2007's TechCrunch40 Conference.", "tag-4": "And ever since then, Jason has been teaching others to \"fish\" by sharing his startup expertise with aspiring entrepreneurs, either through informative (and incredibly entertaining) keynote speeches, and by creating Startups Uncensored, the longest running and most widely attended technology gathering in southern California.", "tag-5": "By the way, Jason definitely knows what he's talking about, since Docstoc.com is now one of the top 500 most visited websites in the world, with 20 million unique visitors per month and 25 million registered users.", "tag-6": "Jason's entrepreneurial knowledge spans from raising seed funding (how's half a million in 45 days?) to integrating multiple revenue streams (Docstoc's first version turned a profit solely through Google AdSense!). How does a startup collect press early? It's worth chasing after -- literally -- since Jason skipped his law school final exam to follow TechCrunch founder Michael Arrington and flood him with a never ending verbal press release...and a few drinks at the bar too.", "tag-7": "But all his virtual presentations and public speaking engagements are just icing on the cake to his own startup career. A former partner at a venture consulting firm, Jason just launched a beta version of License123 to educate new companies about location-specific business licenses. Plus, Docstoc has transformed itself from a complimentary storage space to an online marketplace, and then to a subscription-based service complete with daily articles and videos from business professionals -- including the thought leader himself.", "tag-8": "Tomorrow, Thursday, October 4th at 3 PM EST is your chance to pick Jason's brain about starting a tech company beyond Silicon Valley, fostering an innovative company culture, and successfully reiterating an online product over and over again -- most likely also featuring Jason's hilarious impressions and unabashed sense of humor. Put away your dinner plates and grab your entrepreneurial fishing poles -- we're going to cover it all during our hour-long #StartupLab live chat presented by Citi.", "tag-9": "Don't miss this one -- Jason is nothing short of a startup superhero. (Don't believe us? Check out this awesome blog post he wrote about how 10 traits entrepreneurs have in common with superheroes.)", "tag-10": "Got questions for Jason? Bring them with you Thursday!", "tag-11": "Click here to RSVP to the live chat on Thursday 10/3 with Jason Nazar of Docstoc.com"}
