This indicates that only a few nascent businesspeople prove able to overcoming barriers the barriers related to the early development stage of a business. For every 160 early-stage entrepreneurs, there are only 100 established entrepreneurs. In economically developed countries the number of established business owners exceeds the number of early-stage entrepreneurs.", "tag-5": "The main reason for the discontinuation of a business is its unprofitability, which is connected with entrepreneurs' lack of ability to at the start objectively assess the prospects of their business. Most of those who discontinue their business (58 percent) have no plans to further engage in entrepreneurial activities.", "tag-6": "For most entrepreneurs in Russia, opening their business was an opportunity-driven choice; however, most often their basic motivation is to maintain previous levels of income, as opposed to improving income or attaining independence.", "tag-7": "According to the conclusions drawn in the Russian portion of the study, only an insignificant number of the respondents plan to open their own business in the near future. Only 1 in 20 Russian citizens of working age wants to create a new company. This is the lowest indicator for all countries included in the study. Of countries with a comparable level of development, on average, 1 in 4 declares intentions of becoming an entrepreneur.", "tag-8": "Among respondents with entrepreneurial intentions in Russia, approximately 40 percent are already entrepreneurs planning to open another business.

Eighty-two percent of Russian citizens who are not engaged in entrepreneurial activities believe that they lack the required knowledge and skills for running a business. Meanwhile, only 20 percent of entrepreneurs doubt their own competency. Half of the population fears failure in such entrepreneurial endeavors. Among those who have already launched their business, only one-fourth fear this,\" says Professor Alexander Chepurenko, Academic Supervisor at the Laboratory of Entrepreneurship Research at the National Research University \u2013 Higher School of Economics.", "tag-10": "\"The decision to support this research in particular and double its scale was guided by the fact the GEM methodology is unique throughout the world, which allows to evaluate entrepreneurial activities and compare Russia to the rest of the world on the basis of a unified evaluation matrix,\" notes Viktor Rozhkov, Russian Commercial Banking Head at Citibank. \"This research presents a unique analysis and empirical data to anyone interested in the topics of developing entrepreneurship and its environment. It is very important for Citi as we believe it is necessary to facilitate the development entrepreneurship as one of the main factors for improving the social and economic well being of society. It is apparent in the research that the main reason for the closing of early-stage businesses is unprofitability (45 percent), which in my opinion point to a lack of financial literacy, experience in business planning and basic business skills. This is the reason why the main component of our social programs is entrepreneurial training.\"", "tag-11": "\"The reason for the low level of entrepreneurial activity can be found in the general public's attitude toward entrepreneurs and entrepreneurship. And although 20 percent of Russians say that opening a business is a good career choice, only a few truly consider this opportunity. Only 8 percent of Russians believe that they are capable of running a business and see good prospects for creating a company,\" notes Olga Verkhovskaya, Associate Professor for the Department of Strategic & International Management, GSOM SPbU.", "tag-12": "The Russia 2011 report was published as a part of the Global Entrepreneurship Monitor (GEM) project, which at present is the largest assessment of entrepreneurial activity worldwide.
