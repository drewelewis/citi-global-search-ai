Since our founding 200 years ago, Citi has been proud to support the communities we serve, especially our hometown of New York City and during the past week, we reinforced this commitment by joining our neighbors in extending assistance to those in need.</p>,<p class=\"blog-listing-body\">In the immediate aftermath of the storm, the Citi Foundation donated $1 million to the American Red Cross to support post-Sandy relief and recovery efforts. The $1 million donation supplements a $500,000 grant that the Citi Foundation provides to the Red Cross every year to support the organization's relief activities. Citi has also contributed to organizations focused on local relief and recovery efforts, including the Staten Island-based Stephen Siller Tunnel to Towers Foundation. We also enabled Citi ThankYou\u00ae Rewards members to use their points to make donations to the Red Cross at <a href=\"https://www.thankyou.com/\">www.thankyou.com</a>. <br></p>", "tag-1": "Following Hurricane Sandy, Citi is trying to help by doing its Part"}
