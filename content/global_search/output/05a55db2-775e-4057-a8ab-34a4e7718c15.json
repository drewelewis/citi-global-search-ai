The Congress raised key issues of importance for the economic and social development of Europe.", "tag-3": "The three-day congress provided a platform to tackle key issues relating to Polish, European and global economies, including shale gas in the context of power policy and development prospects for the Polish Investments Company (Polskie Inwestycje). Other highlights from the European Economic Congress 2013 included the second Economic Forum on China, the Africa - Central Europe Economic Cooperation Forum and a session devoted to the Eurozone.", "tag-4": "Experts from Citi Handlowy took part in selected events at the Congress. Krzysztof Kaczmar, President of the Leopold Kronenberg Foundation at Citi Handlowy, participated in a panel discussion on \"Sustainable Investments \u2013 Culture Pays Off.\" Citi was also represented by a team of managers from the Corporate Bank and was a partner of the session on \"Financing Investments in Central Europe.\"", "tag-5": "Czeslaw Piasek, Managing Director and Head of Treasury and Trade Solutions at Citi Handlowy, attended a discussion on \"Polish Development Investments\" (Polskie Inwestycje Rozwojowe) on day two of the congress. He commented: \"In my opinion, it is currently one of the most important topics of economic discussion in Poland. The program changes the approach towards privatization and, as a result, towards the long-term manner of public assets management. The two-pillar structure of the recapitalized BGK and the newly created PIR seems to be an effective tool to mobilize private capital and co-finance long and complex infrastructural projects. The project creates a great opportunity for Poland, and I am convinced that in the longer perspective, with preservation of investment transparency and stability of the entire structure of operational principles, it will be an effective medium of financing the economy.\"", "tag-6": "Jacek Czerniak, Managing Director of Global Subsidiaries Group at Citi Handlowy, took part in the panel discussion on \"Financing investments in Central Europe\" on day three of the Congress. He said: \"From the perspective of banks, first and foremost the strategic industries of the economy should be mentioned \u2013 for example, the extraction industry, power industry or fuel industry. KGHM, which benefits from the support of Citi Handlowy in its international expansion, is an example of a champion in this group. Apart from a particular industry, also the quality of a project and the enterprise strategy are important. If we, for example, take the motor industry, we can see positive effects of the geographical diversification of its operation. Thanks to such an approach, despite the fact that this sector is affected by a slowdown in Europe, it makes up for that in Asia and the United States, and such a policy shapes the total balance and the liquidity of companies. Therefore, at Citi Handlowy we evaluate all the elements that determine the financial situation and the potential of an enterprise. I think this is one of the reasons why we provide services to 70 percent of the biggest companies on the Forbes' list.\"", "tag-7": "The European Economic Congress is a three-day cycle of debates and meetings that hosts thousands of guests from Poland and other European countries. A few hundred panelists take part in over one hundred debates. Each year, it hosts EU commissioners, prime ministers of European countries and representatives of the Polish government. Each Congress is a meeting of key figures from the circles of politics, business, science and economy. The topics raised at the sessions, debates and meetings cover issues significant for the economic and social development of Europe.", "tag-8": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
