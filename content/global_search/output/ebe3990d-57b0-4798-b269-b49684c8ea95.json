It made Citi's global wealth-management expertise available to \"mass affluent\" individuals with $100,000 or more to invest. It was such a success that it was soon adopted, with local adjustments to the minimum investment required, by franchises around the world. By 2011, the service was available in more than 550 Citigold Centers in 36 countries and had just been introduced to Vietnam, where the bank's first retail branch in Ho Chi Minh City had recently opened. For Vietnam, which had a population of about 90 million, the minimum investment was set at $50,000. \"The launch of the Citigold platform and the retail bank is a first step in what I think will be a many-step process of Citi entering the consumer space in a very big way,\" Vietnam country officer Brett Krause said. \"The Citigold brand is fortuitous for us in Vietnam because gold is so important to the Vietnamese. It's a place where gold is central to people's wealth preservation. People trade gold, buy gold and store gold so to have a brand like Citigold is powerful in itself.\""}
