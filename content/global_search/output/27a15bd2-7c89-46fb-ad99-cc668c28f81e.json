Each year, capital losses can be used to reduce realized capital gains and up to $3,000 in ordinary income, or $1,500 if you are married and filing separate federal tax returns. Unused losses can be carried over into future years.", "tag-1": "Turning lemons into lemonade.", "tag-2": "If the recent stock-market turmoil has left you with investments in your regular taxable account that are worth less than the price you paid, you might consider selling them, so you can use the losses to offset taxable gains elsewhere in your portfolio.

If you're selling a security, such as a stock, bond or mutual fund, that you might want to buy again, you can't claim a loss if you purchase the same or a \"substantially identical\" security within 30 days before or after the date of the sale.", "tag-4": "For example, if you sell a losing stock but buy options on the stock, the IRS will see the options as a synthetic security that is substantially identical to the stock and your loss will be disallowed. Similarly, the loss will likely be disallowed if you sell an index fund and then buy another fund that tracks the same index from another fund-management company within 30 days before or after the sale. But if you replaced it with a fund that follows a different index, the IRS probably wouldn't consider it substantially identical. You could also sell, say, a technology company and buy another tech stock and not run afoul of the wash sale rule. Because of these sorts of complexities, you may want to consult a tax advisor.", "tag-5": "None of this, of course, matters if you sell a stock and buy it back after 31 days.
