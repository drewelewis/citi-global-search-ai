", "tag-1": "Thailand: Citi Remains Optimistic About Global Economy Led by Stronger Growth in the U.S.", "tag-2": "HIGHLIGHTS", "tag-3": "Bangkok \u2013 Citi announced its house-view preference of equities over fixed income classes, urging investors to seek out investment opportunities in Europe, Japan, the U.S. and North Asia, the bank shared in its Citigold 2014 Annual Outlook: 'Transitioning to Growth.'", "tag-4": "\"This year, with signs that the U.S. economy is picking up momentum, the growth prospect for the global economy looks brighter,\" said Haren Shah, Chief Investment Strategist for Citi Asia Pacific Wealth Management.", "tag-5": "\"The bond tapering by the Federal Reserve (Fed) will have a significant impact on financial markets and may dictate where opportunities are,\" he added, in reference to the $10 billion in scaled-back bond buying in January this year and further plans to do so this month.", "tag-6": "Nevertheless, Citi expects market volatility around the Fed tapering to be less painful than in 2013. The bank expects that the Fed may only raise interest rates in the third quarter of 2015, with unemployment rate nearing 6 percent and inflation above 1.5 percent.", "tag-7": "Citi analysts expect a modest reacceleration in global real GDP growth from 2.4 percent in 2013 to about 3.1 percent in 2014, the best since 2010. Growth in advanced economies (AE) is expected to grow to 2 percent from 1.1 percent last year.", "tag-8": "Growth is likely to be around 3 percent in the U.S. and U.K. in the coming year while Japan's growth is likely to slow down significantly on the back on consumption tax hikes.", "tag-9": "Emerging markets (EM) growth may continue to outpace AE growth in 2014, as has been the case since 1999.", "tag-10": "However, the EM-AE growth gap in 2014 is likely to be the smallest since 2002 and AE growth might continue to be relatively EM-unfriendly. Citi notes that China may avert a hard landing with growth being stabilized at above 7 percent.", "tag-11": "On investment opportunities in equities, Citi projects global Earnings-Per-Share (EPS) to grow roughly 7 percent in 2014 and expects the MSCI World Index to hit 450 by the end of this year. The main risk for EM equities, the bank says, remains the Fed's tapering of monetary stimulus.", "tag-12": "\"In the U.S., we would remain invested in selected cyclical growth sectors, although our preference would be relatively more focused on Europe and Japan where liquidity is likely to remain ample,\" Citi analysts noted.", "tag-13": "In Europe, Citi prefers core markets which will benefit from global economic recovery such as the U.K., Germany and France. Within EMs, Citi continues to favor North Asia \u2013 China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Korea \u2013 as they remain cheap and could be prime beneficiaries of the recovery in the U.S.", "tag-14": "Citi continues to remain underweight on fixed income but within the bonds space, prefer high yields as credit fundamentals remain relatively strong.", "tag-15": "Citi's outlook on commodities this year remains neutral to bearish, even if conditions improve in AEs and EMs. Seasonal and tail-risk factors could however push prices up, analysts said.", "tag-16": "Citi analysts believe that renewed positive buying momentum in China may prevent a wholesale rout of gold prices in 2014, resulting in prices averaging around US$1,255/oz in the year.", "tag-17": "For the Thai economy, Citi expects a growth of 3.1 percent this year. A weak economy, slow earnings and political uncertainty may result in a slower Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth.", "tag-18": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions. Citi provides consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, transaction services, and wealth management.", "tag-19": "Additional information may be found at www.citigroup.com | Twitter: @Citi | YouTube: www.youtube.com/citi | Blog: http://blog.citigroup.com | Facebook: www.facebook.com/citi | LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/citi"}
