But what did you learn? Here are three key financial insights you can garner from your federal tax return.", "tag-3": "First, look at Schedule D and see how many trades you made, especially trades that resulted in short-term capital gains. Those short-term gains are taxable at ordinary income-tax rates, which could be as high as 35%. What to do? This year, assuming it makes investment sense, you might try to hang onto your winners for more than 12 months, so they're taxed at the long-term capital-gains rate, which is a maximum 15%. You might also limit your trading to retirement accounts, like your 401(k) plan or Individual Retirement Account, where you don't have to pay taxes until money is withdrawn.", "tag-4": "Second, see whether you itemized your deductions using Schedule A or took the standard deduction, which in 2011 is $11,600 for married couples and $5,800 for single individuals. If you took the standard deduction, you aren't getting a tax benefit from your various deductions. One implication: You can't deduct any mortgage interest you're paying--and thus it could make sense to pay off your home loan.", "tag-5": "Finally, figure out what your marginal federal income-tax rate is, which is the rate at which your last dollar of income was taxed. Your tax preparer should be able to tell you--or, if you're using tax software, you might try temporarily adding $100 to your income and see what it does to your overall tax bill.", "tag-6": "If you know your marginal tax rate, it can help you choose between municipal and taxable bonds. Let's say you are in the 28% federal income-tax bracket and you own some munis yielding 3%. To see if taxable bonds might be a better option, you need to calculate your tax-equivalent yield, which tells you how much a taxable bond would have to yield to give you at least as much after-tax income.", "tag-7": "To get this number, take the 3% yield on your munis and divide it by 1 minus your marginal federal rate. Because you are in the 28% bracket, that would mean dividing your munis' 3% yield by 0.72, equal to 1 minus 0.28. (Assuming the munis are tax-free at the state level, you would also need to adjust for your marginal state income-tax rate.) Result: If you remain in the 28% tax bracket, to give you the same after-tax income as your munis, a taxable bond would generally need to yield 4.17%.", "tag-8": "INVESTMENT PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022 NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-9": "The information provided is solely for informational purposes.
