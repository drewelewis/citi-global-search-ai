Under Moses Taylor (bank President from 1856 to 1882) the bank became a vehicle for monitoring and controlling the companies that made up his industrial empire. For deposits, all companies had to keep their principal account with City Bank. In exchange, the bank would extend short-term credits to them as needed. By taking deposits from those with temporary cash surpluses and lending to those with temporary deficits, Taylor was fulfilling the treasury functions of the bank he controlled. It was a provider of liquidity at all times to himself and his companies, the bank's clients. The bank adopted a policy of \"ready money,\" stressing liquidity and investing in call loans as a secondary reserve. It avoided volatile sources of funds. Taylor ran the bank so conservatively, by keeping large amounts of surplus cash, that City Bank was consistently able to fund its clients even during the financial panics that afflicted Wall Street. Clients were shielded from insolvency, and the bank itself was protected from possible failure. It was this conservative policy that made City Bank of New York one of the strongest of the city's banks in the second half of the 19th century. The bank's deposits rose in each of the financial panics during this period, while the average deposits of New York's other banks fell."}
