Since the beginning of 2012, Citigroup has retired approximately US$25 billion of senior debt, subordinated debt, preferred and trust preferred securities, reducing Citigroup's overall funding costs and efficiently deploying its ample liquidity. Citigroup will continue to consider opportunities to redeem or repurchase securities, based on several factors, including without limitation, the economic value, potential impact on Citigroup's net interest margin and borrowing costs, the overall remaining tenor of Citigroup's debt portfolio, as well as overall market conditions.", "tag-4": "As the Expiration Date for the Offers was September 11, 2013, the deadline for tendering Notes pursuant to the Offers has now passed.

The Settlement Date is expected to occur on September 16, 2013 for all series of Notes.", "tag-5": "Because the aggregate principal amount of Notes of certain series validly tendered in an Offer exceeds the Maximum Series Tender Cap for such series, subject to the terms and conditions of the Offers, Citigroup has accepted tendered Notes of such series on a pro rata basis as described in the Offer to Purchase.
