This reduced the number of outstanding shares of Citigroup common stock from approximately 29 billion to approximately 2.9 billion.", "tag-4": "\"Executing the reverse stock split and our intention to reinstate a quarterly common stock dividend are important steps as we anticipate returning capital to shareholders starting next year,\" said Vikram Pandit, Chief Executive Officer of Citigroup. \"Taken together, we believe these actions will reduce volatility while broadening the base of potential investors. Now that we have established consistent profitability, we are working towards our next goal of responsible growth.\"", "tag-5": "No fractional shares were issued in connection with the reverse stock split. Instead, Citi's transfer agent will aggregate all fractional shares that otherwise would have been issued as a result of the reverse stock split and those shares will be sold into the market. Shareholders who would otherwise hold a fractional share of Citigroup common stock will receive a cash payment from the net proceeds of that sale in lieu of such fractional share. Additional information on the treatment of fractional shares and other effects of the reverse stock split can be found in Citi's definitive proxy statement filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March 12, 2010.", "tag-6": "As a result of the reverse stock split, adjustments are required to be made to certain of Citi's outstanding securities including its warrants, convertible preferred stock, T-DECS and the rights issued pursuant to the terms of Citi's Tax Benefits Preservation Plan (the \"Plan\").
