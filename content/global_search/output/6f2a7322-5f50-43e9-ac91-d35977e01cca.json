Citi was the first bank ever to introduce contactless credit cards and contactless payment stickers in the Czech market in 2011. Late last year, it was also the first bank in the Czech market to start offering contactless stickers with VISA credit cards as well. Thanks to the continuously expanding network of contactless terminals in the Czech Republic, the number of contactless transactions is gradually growing while the average amount per contactless credit card transaction is decreasing. Thirty percent of all transactions currently made using Citi credit cards are contactless.", "tag-7": "Czechs use credit cards as a common payment tool", "tag-8": "Citi's internal data shows that clients prefer card payments to cash for lower amounts as well. As a result, the average merchant transaction amount has been decreasing year by year; the amount was CZK 1,000 per transaction in 2013, down from CZK 1,137 in the preceding year. The average amount per contactless transaction using a Citi credit card was CZK 470, and the average amount paid with contactless payment stickers was even lower at CZK 347.", "tag-9": "\"The total amount of transactions made using Citi credit cards has also grown by 18 percent year-on-year,\" says Milan Rezn\u00edcek, Credit Card Product Manager at Citi. \"Turnover on Citi credit cards in December 2013 was a full 40 percent higher than the average of the other months in the year.\"", "tag-10": "The ratio of active clients, i.e., those who use Citi credit cards regularly, is almost three-quarters, confirming the popularity of the payment tool. Citibank has also recorded an increase in the amount of card transactions with merchants per active client. The 22 percent year-on-year increase confirms that people more frequently use cards to pay for smaller purchases, which is the result, among other things, of the ever expanding contactless technology.", "tag-11": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
