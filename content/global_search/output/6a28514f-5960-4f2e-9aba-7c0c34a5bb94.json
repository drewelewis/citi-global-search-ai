We understand the key to building a fair and prosperous city includes connecting young people to jobs, and I am thrilled that Citi's investment will positively impact over 7,000 youth in our region.\"", "tag-7": "\"The future economic competiveness of our cities hinges on the success of our young people,\" said Brandee McHale, President, Citi Foundation. \"Creating competitive cities requires a competitive workforce. That is why the Citi Foundation is committed to investing in career-boosting programs that equip young people to meet their economic ambitions and build a strong financial future in Canada and globally.\"", "tag-8": "Pathways to Progress aims to help reduce youth unemployment in key cities around the world and improve the quality of the youth workforce. Globally, the youth unemployment rate is three times higher than the adult unemployment rate, which reflects a gap in the skills and networks many young people currently possess and what is required by many employers or needed to successfully launch an income-generating business. Through the expansion of Pathways to Progress, Citi and the Citi Foundation continue to work with municipal and community leaders around the world to help young people secure jobs, begin to engage in the formal economy and contribute positively to their cities.", "tag-9": "Pathways to Progress partners in Canada:", "tag-10": "For more information about Pathways to Progress and the study visit Pathways to Progress.
