Launched in 2009 in conjunction with Major League Baseball's annual Jackie Robinson Day, Citi Field Kids has hosted more than 2,500 students.", "tag-3": "The series of in-season events seeks to positively impact students through the ideals of Jackie Robinson, the legendary athlete and civil rights pioneer who broke baseball's color barrier with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947. Fittingly, each program begins at Citi Field in the Jackie Robinson Rotunda, which is inscribed with words and images defining the nine values he embodied -- courage, integrity, determination, persistence, citizenship, justice, commitment, teamwork and excellence.", "tag-4": "Next, the students are greeted by SportsNet New York (SNY) anchor and reporter Michelle Yu, who serves as master of ceremonies. After she tells her story of growing up in the Bronx and the challenges she faced to become the first Chinese woman sportscaster, she introduces a member of the Citi team who shares some of his or her life experience with the kids. This year's guest speakers have included Wes Moore, a Citi vice president, Rhodes Scholar, U.S. Army veteran and author, who discussed The Other Wes Moore: One Name and Two Fates, his best-selling memoir on the similarities and differences between his childhood in Baltimore and that of another boy with the same name; Bill Brown, Regional Executive for Citibank New York City, who told the students to \"think big\"; and Ed Skyler, Citi's Executive Vice President of Global Public Affairs, who joked Jackie's Robinson's principle of commitment was especially important to him growing up as a Mets fan whose father is a Yankees fan.", "tag-5": "A member of the Mets organization also speaks to the kids. Guests this season have included Mets General Manager Sandy Alderson; former Mets captain John Franco; and Major League Baseball Network analyst and two-time American League All-Star Harold Reynolds. A Jackie Robinson Foundation Scholar also seeks to inspire the kids by sharing how their involvement with the Scholars program has helped them achieve their goals. Most are in college or recent college graduates.", "tag-6": "Finally, one lucky student is selected to participate in an on-field experience, which has included throwing out the first pitch, handing the lineup card to the umpire before the game, and helping install the bases on field. The appearance of team mascot Mr. Met signals the end of the program when the kids are given gift bags and escorted to their seats to cheer on the Mets. It's a thrilling and inspiring day."}
