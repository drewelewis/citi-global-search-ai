Similarly, according to a 2012 report by the Center for American Progress, despite a widely-held cautious optimism about the ongoing economic recovery, communities of color continue to lag behind the nation in terms of access to asset building opportunities like entrepreneurship, naturalization or ongoing education.", "tag-6": "\"The programs launched today by the ABPN will provide the blueprints to support economic mobility and sustainable asset building that is so desperately needed in communities across the country,\" said Marc Morial, President and CEO of the National Urban League, a founding member of the ABPN. \"It is in everyone's interest that these innovative programs succeed and get to scale.\"", "tag-7": "The ABPN is a national coalition that collectively advances savings and asset building policy at the federal level, builds national capacity of the network's members, and bolsters long-term financial security for low- and moderate-income communities of color.

Access to better paying jobs and education opportunities are just two of the many advantages of naturalization.
