Talented, young artists who are members of the Budapest Roma Gallery Association will have their paintings showcased on walls of the corridors and offices of the Citi Service Center from September 12 to October 8, 2012.", "tag-3": "The exhibition features the works of four young Roma artists Tibor Balogh (1975), K\u00e1lm\u00e1n K\u00e1li-Horv\u00e1th (1975), Zsolt V\u00e1ri (1974), S\u00e1ndor Kiss (1974) and non \u2013 Roma artists Marianna Bork\u00f3 (1977) and G\u00e1bor Szer\u00e9nyi (1953).", "tag-4": "The opening ceremony for the exhibition was held at the Budapest Citi Service Center on September 12 as part of Citi's O&T Culture Week activities. Maurice Thompson, Citi Country Officer (CCO) for the UK, along with Terry O'Leary, Regional Head of Operations & Technology in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA), and Gregg Morton, Head of Citi Shared Services in EMEA, joined Batara Sianturi, CCO for Hungary, and Bea Elod, Head of the Budapest Citi Service Center, as well as more than 100 service center employees for the opening ceremony.", "tag-5": "Maurice Thompson said: \"I am very impressed by the talent and performance of our Hungary Service Center team of around 700 young professionals serving our Citi entities in the region and globally in various functions. This is a very diverse team in terms of nationality, gender, ethnicity and religion and today our colleagues in Hungary reinforced Citi's commitment to diversity by hosting this Roma Gallery in our premises. I am very pleased to have met these accomplished and enthusiastic artists, and continue to be impressed by the dedication and professionalism of our Service Center team.\"", "tag-6": "Batara Sianturi remarked, \"This initiative represents a creative addition to our long-term strategic community programs in Hungary. I hope that providing these young artists with the opportunity to showcase their work in such a diverse environment as our Citi Service Center will have a positive impact on their careers.\"", "tag-7": "K\u00e1lm\u00e1n K\u00e1li-Horv\u00e1th, one of the Roma artists noted: \"We all come from a very difficult background and have been working hard to achieve our goal of becoming appreciated artists in Hungary, but there is still a long way to go. We believe that everyone's fortunes are in their own hands and everyone has the ability to realize their dreams if they work relentlessly to get there. However, one must be open to, and seek out any opportunities to expand professionally and support their career growth. We consider this initiative a valuable opportunity to enhance our artist profiles and build our careers.\"", "tag-8": "The paintings on display at the Budapest Citi Service Center are as diverse as the artists themselves. Tibor Balogh captures the less famous buildings of Budapest, using light and shadow to bring to life the feelings and emotions of the city. K\u00e1lm\u00e1n K\u00e1li-Horv\u00e1th's painting of a boy and his violin titled \"Look in my eyes!\" conveys mildness and stubbornness, as well as vulnerability. Zsolt V\u00e1ri's painting of \"Greta, a small girl\" is an iconic piece delivering the message that despite difficulties, vulnerability and fear, one can always live with dignity. While most of S\u00e1ndor Kiss's paintings are of 'religious icons', this time he has brought his realist paintings with strong blue influences adding modernity to his usual traditional topics.", "tag-9": "Citi Citigroup, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
