The slowdown in China is likely to prove mild, and, in terms of quarter-on-quarter GDP growth, the second quarter is likely to prove the weakest quarter,\" said Buiter in his opening remarks. He added that growth is expected to remain uneven, and many economies will not be growing particularly strongly this year and in 2012.", "tag-5": "He further added that the European Central Bank (ECB) will most likely signal another 25 bp rate hike in July at its upcoming meeting later this month to about 2.5 percent by end 2012, while U.S. Fed is likely to maintain its rates for the remaining of the year \u2013 provided the economy improves as expected and financial conditions remain supportive.", "tag-6": "Against this background, Citi strategists expect the U.S. dollar to strengthen near term, but weaken medium term.", "tag-7": "\"We believe the recent widening in credit spreads probably has further to run, but look for about 10 percent further upside in global equities by year-end. We advocate caution and expect industrial country bond yields to rise in H2 this year,\" added Buiter.", "tag-8": "Johanna Chua cautioned a global cyclical slowdown in Asia after the region posted stronger-than-expected economic activity in the first quarter, with external demand softening from the global industrial cycle and the impact of Japan supply disruptions.", "tag-9": "\"While growth in the emerging market is holding up better, China's growth is slowing, although it is largely in line with our forecast of 9.2 percent for 2011 and 9 percent for 2012,\" Chua said.", "tag-10": "She explained, \"This is coming against the backdrop of a strong first quarter for Asia, where strong exports played a role in the significant positive growth surprises we saw in China, Singapore, H.K., Taiwan and Thailand.\"", "tag-11": "While China's economy is showing initial signs of a slowdown on tighter policies, power shortage and inventory destocking, Citi economists are confident that a major downturn can be avoided via policy, possibly less monetary tightening as inflation eases, and electricity tariff adjustments to boost power production.", "tag-12": "Citi Citi, the leading global financial services company, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
