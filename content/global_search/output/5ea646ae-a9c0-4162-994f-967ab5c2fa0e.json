Participating cities will also benefit from ongoing interaction with leading practitioners from around the country and share lessons learned to advance progress.", "tag-4": "The City Accelerator builds on the Project on Municipal Innovation (PMI), a collaboration between Living Cities and Harvard Kennedy School's Ash Center for Democratic Governance and Innovation, which brings together mayoral chiefs-of-staff and policy directors from 35 cities across the U.S. to discuss challenges facing their municipalities, including inefficiency in city government and inequality. The City Accelerator helps translate dialogue into action by giving cities seed funding to adopt many of the ideas discussed during the PMI sessions.", "tag-5": "The Citi Foundation's support for the City Accelerator will provide these U.S. cities with the opportunity to apply for one of three cohorts that focus on accelerating a particular type or model of innovation. The selection criteria include having a demonstrated commitment from the mayor and other key leaders and a track record of delivering results. Participants will explore areas where there is a clear model ready for implementation, which senior officials in each participating city will adapt around a chosen issue. The first round of selected cities will be announced this summer.", "tag-6": "\"At a time when cities are experiencing rapid population growth, we are proud to support urban leaders who are seeking solutions to improve services in the midst of an unprecedented shift,\" said Ed Skyler, Citi's Executive Vice President for Global Public Affairs and Chairman of the Citi Foundation. \"For over 200 years, Citi has partnered with cities around the world to support their growth and progress. The City Accelerator will enhance the ability of municipal governments to implement innovative programs and services that deliver impactful results for residents.\"", "tag-7": "\"Many cities today are program-rich, but focus on piecemeal approaches and workaround solutions,\" said Ben Hecht, President and CEO of Living Cities. \"Our belief is that City Accelerator, with support from the Citi Foundation, will help foster the spread of innovation to enable more systematic solutions to address some of the core challenges facing America's cities. We are grateful for the partnership with the Citi Foundation to enable this important work to move forward.\"", "tag-8": "Participating cities in the City Accelerator program will focus on issues with the potential to have profound benefits for residents, such as allocating additional resources to issues like health to achieve better results, or using data in a new and coordinated way across city agencies to improve educational outcomes.", "tag-9": "\"While all cities are unique, they face common challenges,\" said Peter Furman, Chief of Staff for San Jose Mayor Chuck Reed and a PMI participant. \"With City Accelerator, cities can build upon existing best practices and move faster toward implementing approaches that work.\"", "tag-10": "Local governments are critical in promoting widespread economic growth and opportunity, and they benefit from an inherent ability to quickly adapt and experiment in the face of a changing environment. From launching innovation offices and opening up access to municipal data banks, cities have begun taking steps to reinvent themselves in order to solve what were once seen as intractable challenges.", "tag-11": "\"Cities are on the front lines of today's challenges, and we need to get better at accelerating the development of workable solutions,\" said Kristine LaLonde, Nashville Co-Chief Innovation Officer. \"From our city's involvement with PMI, we have seen some smart, forward-thinking approaches to the obstacles all cities face when trying to serve their own diverse constituents. City Accelerator will enable the field to develop smarter solutions together and more quickly.\"", "tag-12": "The City Accelerator builds upon Citi's efforts to help cities become more efficient and empower citizens by providing access to services that enhance livability and prosperity.
