Chua cited that growth risk in Asia is far higher and response is foreseen to be more favorable now compared to the QE2 period.", "tag-5": "\"While U.S. growth was losing momentum on subpar consumption recovery and weak housing back in 2010, it was still running at 2+ percent growth momentum versus current 1.5 to 2.0 percent trajectory \u2013 a figure now seen as being close to 'stall speed' \u2013 while the Eurozone is in a deepening recession. Despite some easing financial stress in periphery, the impact of austerity programs and de-leveraging, on top of possible Greek euro area exit concerns, will likely continue to weigh on the economy for a while,\" Chua said.", "tag-6": "Across Asia As far as the impact of QE3 on Asia's monetary policy stance is concerned, Chua described this as \"ambiguous across central banks,\" given opposing factors of potential rise in inflation/inflation expectations and asset price concerns weighed against wanting to dissuade FX gains from speculative capital inflows and mounting sterilization costs.", "tag-7": "How central banks will respond will depend on four factors: 1) where countries are in their growth-inflation cycle; 2) to what extent QE3 risks fueling liquidity-driven credit booms/asset price risks; 3) to what extent central banks desire to deter FX outperformance; and 4) to what extent a central bank worries about mounting operational losses from sterilizing inflows.", "tag-8": "\"The first two make central banks less inclined to ease; while the latter two may be an incentive for monetary easing,\" said Chua. Philippines as well as countries like India, Thailand and Vietnam, which already have uncomfortably high inflation at their growth-inflation cycle, are constrained from raising inflation further as a result of QE3. Similarly, central banks predisposed to have sensitivity to asset/property price concerns can be particularly more guarded on policy easing.", "tag-9": "On the other hand, countries less keen to see FX outperformance, with benign inflation, may have more incentive to cut. Chua cites Korea as a prime candidate in Asia that may have more incentive to ease monetary policy to deter capital inflows in a QE3 environment, given its current growth-inflation dynamics. In Korea, sensitivity to commodity prices are low, while in Malaysia, another country where inflation is also benign but growth more resilient, food and energy prices are highly subsidized.", "tag-10": "Chua emphasized, \"With a more positive risk tone and prolonged low rates, capital inflows could be particularly strong in countries with strong fundamentals and higher yields.\" Singling out Indonesia, which pursued relatively unconventional monetary policy partly due to concern over its balance sheet, Chua added that the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) may be more inclined to lower rates.", "tag-11": "\"BSP had already used opportunities of a strong risk-on environment to cut rates amidst still robust growth. In the wake of QE3, we've seen statements by BSP warning the use of 'more macroprudential tools to manage capital flows,' but if inflation were to moderate in the coming months, we wouldn't rule out a greater incentive for one more rate cut,\" said Chua.", "tag-12": "Capital Raising For Basel 3 Meanwhile, Citi Country Officer for the Philippines Sanjiv Vohra said the positive momentum around capital-raising should continue. Vohra cited the recent US$1 billion Rights Offer of Banco de Oro where Citi served as Joint Lead Manager and Joint Underwriter", "tag-13": "\"We're proud to have participated in this landmark transaction, which was the largest ever capital raise in the local equity markets. We worked closely with the client to achieve successful pricing and obtain a tighter discount than precedent Philippine and Asian bank rights issues, despite volatile markets and amidst the Eurozone debt crisis. The offering also achieved seamless and broad marketing process \u2013 Citi leveraged on its global network, bringing BDO management to 70 institutional investors during an international roadshow covering six cities in Asia, Europe and the U.S.,\" related Vohra.", "tag-14": "This year, Citi is celebrating its 200th anniversary as a global company. In the Philippines, it continues to be the largest foreign bank and remains the dominant wholesale and retail banking franchise. It is the only foreign player that has entered and consistently ranks among the top 10 commercial banks in the country.", "tag-15": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
