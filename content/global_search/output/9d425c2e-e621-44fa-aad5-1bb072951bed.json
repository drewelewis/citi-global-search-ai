The real answer? Just do it!", "tag-4": "Gagan Biyani, this week's live chat host (RSVP here -- if you missed the last live chat, you can watch previous chats on demand here) and former Udemy Co-Founder/President, is living proof that execution is 9/10 of the law. He's super-smart, of course -- no surprise there -- but as an Econ grad from UC Berkeley, he first went the traditional (some would say \"safe\") route, working for Accenture and Microsoft.", "tag-5": "Great jobs for a top-shelf Econ grad.", "tag-6": "...Boring jobs for an entrepreneur at heart. Gagan got SO bored, in fact, that he started reading about tech companies whenever he had a spare minute. He loved what he read so much so that he wanted to start his own tech company.", "tag-7": "Not only that, but he convinced TechCrunch to let him write about tech. (Yeah, THAT TechCrunch.) And he applied to a startup incubator to learn everything he possibly could about execution, which is where he met his co-founders. They were already building Udemy, a marketplace to revolutionize online education, under another name in Turkey; Gagan saw a major opportunity to disrupt education as we know it -- and hopped on board.", "tag-8": "In other words, Gagan prepared by diving in headfirst and taking every available opportunity to learn, read and even write about his own future.", "tag-9": "As a first-time founder, Gagan has successfully led investor relations, finance, business development, public relations, operations and oh yeah, user acquisition, too.", "tag-10": "He's raised the company's $4 million in venture capital. He hired 10 of Udemy's 20 employees. AND he managed the team that would create over $2 million in sales during the platform's first 18 months, garnering enthusiastic shout-outs in Bill Gates' annual letter and The New York Times. Now, he's hard at work on new projects, including the Growth Hackers Conference.", "tag-11": "Bottom line? Never, ever say you can't get what you want if you try. The knowledge is out there. It's up to you to find it!", "tag-12": "This Thursday, October 25th at 3 PM EST, during an hour-long, interactive live chat presented by Citi, #StartupLab invites you to ask Gagan Biyani questions about every tech startup-related topic you can think of (after all, he's pretty much THE expert), from the future of edutech to venture capital to tips for driving sales on a brand-new platform.", "tag-13": "We're REALLY excited to pick Gagan's brain, and can't wait to \"see\" you there.", "tag-14": "Click here to RSVP to the live chat with Gagan Biyani of Udemy this Thursday"}
