Lower revenues in Local Consumer Lending and in Brokerage and Asset Management drove the decline in Citi Holdings revenues from the prior year period, partially offset by an increase in Special Asset Pool revenues. The decline in Local Consumer Lending revenues reflected the ongoing decline in assets while the decline in Brokerage and Asset Management reflected a lower equity contribution from MSSB and lower private equity marks. The Special Asset Pool revenues grew versus the prior year period due to lower funding costs as well as an improvement in asset marks.
