For example, the November 2010 due period began on October 27, 2010 and ended on November 24, 2010, a total of 29 days. By contrast, the December 2010 due period is 34 days long. The annualization factor for the percentages noted in the tables is 365, or 366 in the case of a leap year, divided by the number of days in the due period. Thus, variation in the number of days in due periods can have a pronounced effect on the annualized percentages shown in the tables."}
