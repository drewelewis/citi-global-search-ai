We went to see the massive kilns being prepared to fire the first San Francisco-made tile in more than 50 years at Heath Ceramics.", "tag-3": "For me, as Executive Director of SFMade, -- founded at the height of the Recession in 2010 with a mission to support and build San Francisco's urban manufacturing sector -- seeing this project come to fruition is a reflection of our community's collective work to grow our local manufacturing base. From helping Heath locate the vacant former commercial laundry building that would become their home, to navigating planning and permitting, to assisting with the hiring of new employees, SFMade has collaborated with Heath and a wide array of private- and public-sector stakeholders -- including the active support of our own Mayor Ed Lee - to realize what is now a model for other local manufacturers and other neighborhoods. And for Heath Ceramics, their decision to build a factory in San Francisco (the original factory in Sausalito is still operating) represents a homecoming of their own: Heath was actually founded by Edith Heath on Clay Street in San Francisco.", "tag-4": "Across San Francisco, local manufacturing is once again taking its rightful place as a powerful actor in our urban fabric. From our humble beginnings with 12 founding manufacturers, SFMade membership has swelled to over 400 companies -- all located and producing product in the city limits of San Francisco. This vibrant sector now employs over 3200 people, the majority of whom live in San Francisco as well. In 2012 alone, the sector created more than 12.5% net new jobs, drawing a diverse workforce that includes veterans, immigrants, and young adults from low-income households. As exciting, urban manufacturing has a powerful entrepreneurial component: close to 40 percent of the companies that make up San Francisco's manufacturing base are younger than three years old.", "tag-5": "Local manufacturers are here and growing, powered by the energy of our neighborhoods, of other proximate companies and sectors, and most of all by a robust local consumer base and the creativity and craft of the people who lead and work for them. In turn, local manufacturers give back to our neighborhoods by creating jobs, adding vibrancy, and driving economic opportunity. When Heath's new facility is at full scale, it will provide 30-40 jobs in one of San Francisco's most ethnically diverse inner-city neighborhoods.", "tag-6": "Best of all, the trend to reclaim a place for making in our cities can be observed across the country -- from a growing food manufacturing cluster in Boston, to a vibrant apparel design and garment manufacturing sector in Manhattan, to what remains one of the most significant tool and die manufacturing bases in the country, in Chicago. To help cities better partner with each other -- to share best practices case studies like Heath and to develop a working national network of manufacturing practitioners -- the Urban Manufacturing Alliance (UMA) was conceived in 2011 by SFMade and The Pratt Center in New York, and formally launched in 2012 with support from major grants from Citi Community Development as well as the SURDNA Foundation. Over the next 18 months, the UMA and its more than 20 participating cities will hold bi-monthly working sessions with UMA member cities - which include cities as diverse as Philadelphia, Chicago, Atlanta, Boston, and Detroit - as well as an annual convening, publish two toolkits that will replicate powerful best practices and inform national economic policy, and deploy three innovative Regional Manufacturing Initiatives, in San Francisco and Oakland, Chicago, and New York City.", "tag-7": "At the same time our national work is gaining traction, my thoughts turn back to my daughters, as they stare with wonder at stacked blue tiles on a shelf. \"I want to MAKE THOSE, when I am older\" says my five-year-old. And I am struck at the opportunity that lies before us to create new career pathways into manufacturing and to reimagine what \"making work\" can be.", "tag-8": "In all this, cities have such a powerful role to play - by linking young people to apprenticeships at local manufacturers that are transit accessible; through expanded \"maker\" education which include self-taught skills gained in one of many urban \"maker/hacker\" facilities like TechShop - where SFMade is housed; and by creating innovative programs through partnerships with urban community colleges and high schools to support both vocational and traditional education.", "tag-9": "But perhaps most of all, the catalytic power of modern urban manufacturing lies in the simple possibility to expose even our youngest makers to the wonders of a small blue tile, made in a massive orange kiln, a two-block walk from home."}
