By amending these federal laws to include sexual orientation and gender identity, the historic legislation would ensure that LGBTQ+ Americans are afforded the same rights as other protected groups.", "tag-1": "Citi's Continued Support of The U.S. Equality Act", "tag-2": "Yesterday, the United States House of Representatives passed The Equality Act, which would amend existing civil rights laws to provide non-discrimination protections to Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer, Intersex, and Asexual people across key areas, including employment, housing, credit, education, and jury duty.

Our company policies have long aligned with the workplace protections outlined in the Act, but it's past time for those protections to be extended to all LGBTQ+ people, regardless of where they work or live."}
