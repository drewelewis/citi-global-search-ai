Voters rated two Citi projects as the top \"Green\" efforts of the year in a tie and a third project as best in the \"Preservation\" category.", "tag-3": "In coverage of the competition, Affordable Housing Finance magazine noted that the first \"Green\" winner -- the Branch of Hope Apartments, a 100-unit supportive housing project developed in association with Interfaith Housing Development Corporation of Chicago -- drew attention for its cutting-edge use of geothermal heating and cooling in an inner-city setting. Citi Community Capital committed $11.3 million in construction loans and $4.75 million in permanent financing to complete this deal.", "tag-4": "The second -- a renovation of Vintage Oaks Senior Apartments in Citrus Heights, Calif. -- earned honors for a successful solar retrofit of the property, leading to an offset of up to 100 percent of the common area and resident electric use and also helping the builder, USA Properties Fund, Inc., to evaluate the potential of solar technology in more settings. In the transaction, Citi Community Capital provided an immediately funded permanent loan of $15.52 million using New Issue Bond Program (NIBP) bonds with Freddie Mac credit enhancement.", "tag-5": "A third project, Kukui Gardens Apartments in Honolulu, led by EAH Housing and Devine & Gong, Inc., Citi Community Capital and other key partners, won in the \"Preservation\" category for a deal that saved critical affordable housing development on the edge of Honolulu's Chinatown from becoming market-rate property.
