Our role is not merely to further people's material well-being -- though that is vitally important. The value of banks runs deeper. Human rights and democracy reach their full potential only where there is economic inclusion for all. That in turn requires financial inclusion -- access to basic financial products and services.", "tag-7": "We approach financial inclusion through what we call Responsible Finance. This is the unifying idea on which we have rebuilt and reorganized our bank in the wake of the financial crisis. It has three key pillars of responsibility: to customers, the financial system, and to the broader community.", "tag-8": "Before we enter into any transaction, we ask ourselves three questions: Is it in the best interest of our customer? Is it systemically responsible? And does this create economic value? The answer to each must be an overwhelming \"yes.\"", "tag-9": "From innovative programs that have helped more than one million Americans in their efforts to avoid potential foreclosure to a new, disciplined approach to risk management, Responsible Finance is being ingrained throughout Citi's practices and culture, globally.", "tag-10": "Responsible Finance is partly about the bottom line. No one wants to see another crisis. Also, our shareholders expect -- and have every right to expect the company to be profitable and well-managed.", "tag-11": "But it's also about our responsibilities to the communities we serve. It's a natural fit for us to put our money, talent, experience and products to work in communities where access to financial services is limited, and to strive to include more people in the financial system.", "tag-12": "An inclusive society depends on disclosure, one of the conditions of the Global Compact to which we recommit. Our 11th annual Global Citizenship Report provides the evidence that we are not only fulfilling our commitments but willing to talk about the considerable challenges we face in promoting Responsible Finance.", "tag-13": "The full 2010 Citizenship report is available at citizenship.citigroup.com.
