I moved there for graduate school, stayed on to build a career, and came back to launch a venture that eventually led me to my current role at Citi.

Citi's North America CEO Bill Mills talked about how, in an increasingly urbanized, globalized and connected society, Miami is an example of how American cities can connect themselves to the wider world.", "tag-1": "Lessons from Miami, the Future of American Cities", "tag-2": "Miami was my first city.

Foreign multinationals and U.S.-based global organizations like Citi are progressively headquartering their Latin America operations in Miami. In fact, 800 use the city for their regional or global headquarters, with great effects on Miami's economy, tax base, and employment rolls.", "tag-4": "The City of Miami has gone beyond its obvious economic success as a world-class tourist destination and redefined itself as the financial and business capital of Latin America. It draws on the talents and dynamism of its diverse population and attracts investment that is driving growth and progress for its residents, making it a hub for an entire region.", "tag-5": "Along the way, it has also become a city where people want to live, work and do business. Miami has worked hard to create a vibrant and livable core, one whose skyline I watched emerge through the window of my own downtown loft apartment. The cultural diversity that is so central to the city's identity brings fresh ideas and approaches, and a thriving art scene blends creativity with neighborhood revitalization to achieve meaningful economic impact.", "tag-6": "While I no longer call Miami home, I'm thrilled to collaborate with colleagues there who are at the forefront of the solutions needed to further develop its role in the region and to help its neighborhoods and people thrive. I believe Miami's trajectory is one that other cities can learn much from. It is, in many ways, the future of American cities.", "tag-7": "To learn about how other cities are fueling urban progress, visit Citi for Cities."}
