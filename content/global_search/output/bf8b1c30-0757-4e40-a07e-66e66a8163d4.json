Share of international payments has grown to 28 percent in 2011 as compared to 20.1 percent in 2010. Citibank's experts estimate that the total amount of purchases made abroad through the end of 2011, including credit card spending, will amount to 3 percent of the GDP, or US$40 billion.", "tag-1": "Russian Spend Abroad Beats Pre-Crisis Records", "tag-2": "HIGHLIGHTS", "tag-3": "Moscow \u2013 The aggregate spend made by Russians abroad in 2011 has reached pre-crisis 2007 levels, according to Citibank's annual research published today. Share of international payments has grown to 28 percent in 2011 as compared to 20.1 percent in 2010. Citibank's experts estimate that the total amount of purchases made abroad through the end of 2011, including credit card spending, will amount to 3 percent of the GDP, or US$40 billion.", "tag-4": "During the summer months in 2010, August and September were the months in which the highest amounts were spent. In 2011, the expenditure growth started in spring, and the traveling spree continued even when the New Year holiday season was over. At the same time, the share of New Year holidays spend grew from 26 percent to 31.7 percent of the total spend amount, as compared to 2010.", "tag-5": "\"Since the beginning of 2011, we have witnessed a substantial growth in consumer activity that is exceeding the pre-crisis period,\" says Michael Berner, Consumer Lending Head at Citibank. \"Our clients are actively using credit cards both in Russia and abroad, as well as in the Internet.\"", "tag-6": "As usual, the most popular countries were the U.S. (16 percent of the total spend volume), Italy (11 percent), the U.K. (8 percent), France (9 percent) and Spain (4 percent). Turkey and Thailand exited the top 10 and passed the baton to Germany (3 percent) and United Arab Emirates (4 percent).", "tag-7": "This year, travelers stopped saving on hotels and indulged themselves in nicer hotel accommodation. According to experts, this is illustrated by an increased spend volume in the hotels category (22 percent). At the same time, Russian consumers cooled down in terms of tourist agencies and air travel as compared to other categories, though in absolute numbers, costs associated with air travel have increased. Clothes and shoes are still a key priority for Russians traveling abroad (#1 after hotels with 15 percent of the total spend volumes), particularly in Italy and the U.K. Jewelry and luxurious goods, purchases in stores, supermarkets and duty-free shops are also on the rise again.", "tag-8": "U.S. or Europe?  The U.S. is at the top of the list again thanks to the high transportation costs, though in 2011 overall spend volumes for America, as compared to the costs incurred in other countries, were lower than in 2010 (18 percent in 2010 and 16 percent in 2011, respectively). Russians started to spend more in Italy and France: 11 percent (as compared to 9 percent last year), and 9 percent (as compared to 7 percent in 2010), respectively. However, the aggregate spend in Britain was less impressive. Switzerland (4 percent) and Finland (4 percent) grew in spend amounts: these skiing countries are popular in the context of winter holidays. In general, as compared to 2010, the major part of Russian foreign credit card spending fell to the European countries, and a smaller part to the U.S.", "tag-9": "It should be taken into consideration that the bulk of expenses related to the U.S., U.K. and Italy spending are also connected with internet purchases; for instance, for the U.S., two-thirds of the total spend volume comes from internet shops (63 percent of the total spend in this country). In Luxembourg (3 percent of the aggregate spend volume), almost 100 percent of purchases were made in the internet shops registered in this country.", "tag-10": "What do they buy in Mauritius?  Mauritius and Malaysia extended the list of most popular countries by the average transaction amount in 2011. Based on the average cost of the most expensive purchases made during the analyzed period, Mauritius tops the list with an average transaction amount of US$673: this romantic island does have luxurious hotels and jewelry shops. The same categories proved to be in demand in Malaysia (91 percent for hotels and 2 percent for jewelry). The average transaction amount in this country has substantially increased compared to 2010 (US$347 and US$67 in 2011 and 2010, respectively). Switzerland also gets to the top through its expensive accommodation (24 percent of the total spend), while in Portugal and Argentine Russian travelers took to their leather goods (6 percent of the total spend in these countries). Israel attracted attention, inter alia, through its elite medical centers (3 percent).", "tag-11": "Where do romantic Russians live?  Statistics of payments made by residents of Moscow and St. Petersburg show that Muscovites have a soft spot for the U.S. (19 percent of the total spend amount), Italy (12 percent) and U.K. (9 percent), whereas St. Petersburg inhabitants, apart from trips to the U.S. and Italy (11 percent and 12 percent, respectively), often find themselves on the road to the neighboring Finland (12 percent of the aggregate spend volume), or \u2013 even more often \u2013 in romantic France (impressive 14 percent of the total spend).", "tag-12": "Methodology.", "tag-13": "The study uses statistical data on purchases made by Citibank's clients with credit cards abroad. The study analyzed the monthly data for the period between January 2007 and June 2011. The randomly selected sampling of at least 50,000 respondents included Citibank's clients over 22 years old who reside in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Samara, Nizhniy Novgorod, Yekaterinburg and other cities with population of greater than 1,000,000 residents.", "tag-14": "Data for the first five months of 2011 and the statistical trends for the past four years have been used to build a forecast through the end of 2011.", "tag-15": "The study did not analyze data on expenditures made by individual credit cardholders and instead used generalized statistical data.", "tag-16": "ZAO Citibank ZAO Citibank, a full subsidiary of Citi in Russia, has been operating since 1993 when it became one of the first banks with foreign capital to enter the Russian market.
