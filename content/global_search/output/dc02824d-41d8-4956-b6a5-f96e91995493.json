Eight Danzhai women batik artisans, representing the 1,000 households, demonstrated the production of batik during the event. Ms. Nancy Zhang, Head of Commercial Bank for Citi China, Ms. Wang Li, Head of Citizenship for Citi China, Professor Ren Xiaodong, Executive Director of Community-Based Conservation and Development Research Center of Guizhou (CCDRC), guests from local government, program partners, as well as Danzhai batik artisans attended the event.", "tag-5": "With the goal of increasing household enterprises' income from batik while strengthening their cultural identity and providing a viable and sustainable alternative income that does not harm the local environment, the program will produce positive impact in three key areas. First, better batik production techniques will see the average production of each household enterprise taking part in the program double in quantity, while also improving in quality. Second, artisans will acquire improved negotiation skills and better links to markets, and in turn should be able to obtain higher prices for their batik craftwork. Third, the artisans will be taught how to effectively manage resources, such as the batik dye, in a more eco-friendly manner.", "tag-6": "Ms. Nancy Zhang said, \"We are committed to contributing to the economic and social development of Western China. Last year, Citi was delighted to be the first foreign bank to open for business in Guiyang, and we will continue to support initiatives such as the Batik Development program, which make a positive and meaningful contribution to Guizhou Province and beyond.\"", "tag-7": "Mr. Bill Carmean, TMI's Chairman and Executive Director, said: \"Our partnership with Citi China and CCDRC is making a sustainable difference in Guizhou. This innovative program is another example of our work in mountain communities around the world to promote sustainable development, conservation and indigenous cultures. The Batik development program would not have been possible without Citi's ongoing involvement and strong commitment to local communities. In fact, Citi's commitment to corporate social responsibility was a key factor for both the success of this project and the primary reason for TMI's interest in collaborating with Citi.\"", "tag-8": "Professor Ren Xiaodong said, \"As an organization committed to empowering Guizhou mountain communities for better lives, we are proud to partner with Citi and TMI to develop such an innovative program to effectively address the needs of local people.\"", "tag-9": "Danzhai County is one of the most poverty-stricken counties in China, with an average annual income per capita below 1,196 Renminbi ($184). The area is the cradle of the ancient Miao handicraft of wax printing or batik, which is a national level cultural treasure with significant artistic as well as market value. However, rural artisans lack market access and information to generate profit from their batik craft. Through the batik skill trainings and workshops such as project packaging held at the village-level, the women artisans and small household enterprises will be building their capacity to increase productivity of higher-quality products, negotiate for better prices, expand channels to markets and eventually raise standards of living and strengthen cultural identity.", "tag-10": "TMI For nearly four decades, The Mountain Institute has been protecting mountain environments, communities and cultures.
