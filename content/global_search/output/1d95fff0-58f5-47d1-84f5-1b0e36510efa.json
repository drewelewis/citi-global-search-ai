In 2010, after meeting important milestones, the Citi Realty Services team expanded on the company's existing goals by creating additional targets for 2015 which include: reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from buildings by 25%, reducing waste to landfill by 40%, reducing water use by 20% and having 15% of the real estate portfolio LEED-certified by the US Green Building Council. (These reduction metrics are based on a 2005 baseline).", "tag-1": "Driving sustainability gains.", "tag-2": "We began measuring the environmental impact of Citi facilities and publicly released our first carbon footprint reduction goal in 2006.

Citi launched a Sustainable Supplier Program in 2009, and we've found that our suppliers have been eager to help us drive our sustainable performance.", "tag-4": "One innovative example of how a vendor is helping us reach our environmental targets is the rePurpose program developed by furniture manufacturer Herman Miller. Herman Miller worked with Citi's team to design durable, cost-effective furniture solutions for a branch environment that met or exceeded LEED (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) standards, and then, through the rePurpose program, ensured that the old branch furniture was refurbished and donated by Citi to local community non-profits like Habitat for Humanity, rather than discarded into a landfill. This collaborative program resulted in 159 tons of waste diverted from landfill and the donation of just under 4,000 pieces of furniture to deserving families.", "tag-5": "We recently acknowledged the innovative contributions of our corporate realty suppliers at an Earth Week Supplier Summit. As noted at the summit, sustainability is a priority for a growing number of Citi's employees, customers and suppliers, and we hope our program continues to drive even more improvements to our supply chain.", "tag-6": "More information about Citi's environmental sustainability efforts is available here: https://www.citigroup.com/citi/citizen/operations/index.htm."}
