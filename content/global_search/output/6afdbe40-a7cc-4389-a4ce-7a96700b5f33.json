As the title sponsor for the 7<sup>th</sup> year, Citi was thrilled to recognize the positive impact the Washington Tennis & Education Foundation (WTEF), the tournament's owner and beneficiary, has had on the surrounding D.C. community by using tennis as a vehicle to empower young people and set them on a path to reaching their full potential. As one of just a few tournaments in the world owned and operated by a non-profit organization, the Citi Open is a great example of how a public company and a private charitable group can work together towards the common goal of making a real difference in young people's lives.", "tag-1": "See the Commemorative Mural Citi Commissioned to Celebrate the 50th Anniversary of the Citi Open", "tag-2": "Last week we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Citi Open Tennis Tournament in Washington, D.C.

In a community where high school graduation rates are persistently low, the WTEF maintains a 100 percent high school completion rate for participating students. Through our sponsorship of the Citi Open, Citi helps the WTEF raise funds and expand its programs to help benefit D.C. youth.", "tag-7": "Overall, this year's tournament was another resounding success and a special milestone in our partnership. Our mission at Citi is to enable growth and progress in the communities we serve, both of which are key components of our work with the WTEF. The result is a perfect match set for tennis fans and the greater Washington D.C. community alike."}
