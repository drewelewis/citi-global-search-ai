Clare said: \"The positive impact I have felt from those I consider to be role models has helped me on so many occasions during my career, so to be recognized as Stonewall's Bi Role Model of the Year is a real honor. Everyone needs role models in life, but I think we all have a responsibility to make our workplaces and our communities more accepting so that everyone can thrive. I'm lucky to work at an organization as supportive as Citi, where inclusion is such an important part of our culture and where we are continually striving to do more.\"", "tag-5": "The Stonewall's Workplace Equality Index is an annual audit of workplace culture for lesbian, gay, bi and trans staff. Over 400 employers submitted entries to the 2018 Index, across the public, private and third sectors, as part of the Index there is a staff feedback questionnaire that participating employers can ask their staff to complete. This year Stonewall received over 92,000 responses to the staff survey, making it one of the largest national employment surveys in Britain. All of the top 100 are members of Stonewall's Diversity Champions program.", "tag-6": "Darren Towers, executive director, Stonewall, said: \"Citi and all those who have made this year's Top 100 Employers list have done a fantastic job. Taking part in our Index shows real commitment to understanding and advancing LGBT equality. This year, for the first time, the Index looked at what employers were doing for trans equality in the workplace. This work is crucial. We recently published LGBT in Britain: Trans Report, which revealed the profound inequality facing trans people in Britain today. Half of trans people have hidden their identity at work for fear of discrimination. This must change, and it's encouraging to see so many organizations make a commitment to trans equality. With their support and hard work we can create a world where all lesbian, gay, bi and trans employees are welcomed and accepted without exception.\"", "tag-7": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
