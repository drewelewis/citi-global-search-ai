Most dairy farmers own just two to three cows and make only 60 cents per day. StellApps, a Citi India client, offers a range of solutions to digitize the supply chain and increase farmer incomes. The company provides electronic sensors to boost diary production, digital cloud and routing systems for real-time grading and pricing, animal facial recognition to support insurance identification and claims, and even offers QR codes for fast-moving consumer goods companies providing the diary in markets. These technologies resolve key pain points in dairy production and enable Stellapps to use supply chain data to underwrite credit through an innovative scoring mechanism and expand access to working capital for smallholder farmers. Thorough this intervention, StellApps calculates that farmers' income can increase at least tenfold, giving them the possibility to purchase more cows and expand their businesses.", "tag-4": "Across Africa, millions of households still rely on kerosene for lighting, which is a fire hazard and can cause impaired lung function, asthma, cancer and increased susceptibility to infectious diseases such as tuberculosis. d.light combines solar power with mobile payments and small dollar loans to make access to electricity accessible and affordable to their clients on a pay-as-you-go basis.
