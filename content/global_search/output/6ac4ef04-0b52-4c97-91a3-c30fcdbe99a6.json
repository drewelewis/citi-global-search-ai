The sample of more than 100 mayors from 41 states were interviewed throughout the summer of 2016 and nearly mirrored the partisan breakdown of mayors nationally.", "tag-5": "Mayors stated that while addressing issues of income inequality, the shrinking middle class and immigration are on their respective municipal agendas, their most pressing economic concern is poverty. Collectively, nearly half the mayors explained that those living in or near poverty are the most excluded group in their cities and a quarter identified the poor as the group they most need to do more to help. Notably, 20 percent of mayors believe the single best thing they can do for those in poverty is to address housing concerns and education.", "tag-6": "\"No matter what part of the country, mayors are facing similar challenges: education, transportation, affordable housing and poverty,\" said Fort Worth Mayor Betsy Price. \"The Menino Survey shines a light on these shared concerns and provides mayors the opportunity to work together and with our partner organizations to respond to these challenges across our cities.\"", "tag-7": "Consistently, mayors' answers to a range of questions, including those on polarizing election issues such as race, immigration and economics, were virtually identical irrespective of whether their cities are located in \"blue\" or \"red\" states. The survey, now in its third year, shows that both Democratic and Republican mayors representing large and small cities are attuned to the plight of their most vulnerable residents, as well as the benefits of immigration and diversity.", "tag-8": "More than half of mayors cited the black community and a quarter of mayors cited both immigrants and Latinos as being one of the most marginalized group in their cities. In response, mayors came to a consensus that the single best thing they can do to support marginalized groups is foster public recognition and build more inclusive cities.", "tag-9": "Many mayors noted that the benefits of building inclusive communities extend beyond social cohesion and that diversity contributes to their city's creativity and innovativeness (72 percent), helps current business and the economy (30 percent), and makes the city more attractive to new residents and businesses (25 percent).", "tag-10": "However, mayors differed on their top policy priorities. Mayors of big cities\u2014cities with more than 300,000 residents\u2014rated quality of life as their top policy priority (30 percent), while more than 25 percent of mayors of small and medium-sized cities rated economic development as their top priority.", "tag-11": "Released at the Rockefeller Foundation headquarters on Tuesday (Jan. 10, 2017) with a presentation of key findings, the survey\u2014named in honor of the late Mayor Thomas M. Menino of Boston\u2014underscores mayors' collective hope for an urban champion in the White House. Mayors cited their reliance on federal agencies to help tackle issues like poverty and economic development, and on the federal government for critical funding support. Investment in infrastructure, including roads, bridges and mass transit, was cited as the top priority for receiving federal assistance.", "tag-12": "\"Our cities need a federal partner that understands the importance of the work being done in American cities,\" said Seattle Mayor Ed Murray. \"From providing affordable housing and supporting economic development, to improving transportation and making our communities safer, mayors are responsible for ensuring that cities provide opportunity for all residents. This survey gives mayors a voice and makes our needs clear.\"", "tag-13": "\"Mayors take action. They are collaborators by nature but they are also willing to go it alone in order to better serve their constituents. Our office, the Boston University Initiative on Cities, was co-founded by one of America's most revered mayors, Tom Menino, and we have a profound appreciation for the job mayors do every day,\" said Graham Wilson, Director of the BU Initiative on Cities. \"We hope that the Menino Survey provides a platform for mayors to share their needs with a national audience, particularly the incoming presidential administration.\"", "tag-14": "\"The 2016 Menino Survey of Mayors provides important and timely insights into some of the largest and most complex issues facing the nation's mayors at a time of significant transition,\" said Bob Annibale, Global Director of Citi Community Development and Inclusive Finance. \"One of the report's most important findings is that mayors, irrespective of political affiliation or city size, increasingly agree that tackling poverty, exclusion and wealth inequality are top priorities. This growing consensus is cause for optimism that our urban leaders stand ready to collaborate with all levels of government, and the private sector, to address the many challenges facing cities.\"", "tag-15": "The key findings of the survey \u2013 which can be read in full at www.surveyofmayors.com \u2013 are below. Follow the conversation on social media using the hashtag #MeninoSurvey.", "tag-16": "POVERTY \u2013 Mayors are deeply concerned about urban poverty and the challenges facing their poorest residents. Our findings suggest a deep sensitivity to the needs of the most economically disadvantaged residents who call cities home.", "tag-17": "INCLUSION \u2013 Mayors worry about many resident groups being left out or left behind, and believe there are both formal and informal means by which they can build more inclusive communities.", "tag-18": "ETHNIC DIVERSITY & IMMIGRATION \u2013 Mayors worry a lot about building more inclusive communities that also welcome immigrants and Latinos.", "tag-19": "CITY IMAGE \u2013 While mayors believe that a wide variety of attributes strengthen their cities' reputation, it is critical that their city be regarded as a safe place for businesses, residents, and visitors.", "tag-20": "POLITICAL RELATIONSHIPS \u2013 Mayors work closely with local and regional government and believe in-person interactions with constituents are important for maintaining a good connection with their city.", "tag-21": "FEDERAL COLLABORATION \u2013 Throughout the summer of 2016, mayors shared both deep concerns about the impact of the presidential campaign rhetoric as well as their hopes for the next administration.", "tag-22": "HIGHER ELECTED OFFICE \u2013 America's mayors are interested in and actively recruited for higher political office, though many would be happy if mayor was their last public office.", "tag-23": "PARTISAN IMMUNITY \u2013 One of the most consistent patterns in the 2016 responses is that mayors' answers were virtually identical irrespective of whether their cities are located in \"blue\" or \"red\" states.", "tag-24": "The Initiative on Cities The Boston University Initiative on Cities researches, promotes, and advances the adaptive urban leadership strategies and policies necessary to support cities as dynamic and inclusive centers of growth and positive development in the 21st century.
