The company needed to eliminate manual operational processes around forecasting of their non-dollar accounts as well as convert negative yielding Euro currency to US Dollars, which is the company's functional currency. Citi's Cross-Currency Sweeps solution helped the client automate their cash concentration process, enabled a more effective use of their liquidity, and provided a higher investment yield in their functional currency.", "tag-9": "\"With most customer receipts in US Dollars, as a company we are still required to maintain non-dollar accounts to support ongoing operating expenses. This requires resources from our treasury group to spend time forecasting non-dollar payments and to coordinate funding of individual accounts. In addition, negative yielding currencies such as EUR in London have a carry cost for us. Citi's Cross Currency Sweeps solution has provided us with cash efficiency and concentration as well as the benefit of reduction in administrative overhead. This innovative sweep solution with integrated FX has significantly improved our overall cash management strategy,\" says Robert Lambert, Assistant Treasurer at Micron.", "tag-10": "CitiCiti, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
