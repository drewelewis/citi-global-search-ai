As recently as 2011, half of the world's population was unbanked. The last official data from the World Bank (2017) shows just under one third of the world's adults (or 1.7 billion people) remained \"unbanked\" or outside the formal financial system.", "tag-1": "Banking the Next Billion: Digital Financial Inclusion in Action", "tag-2": "More people have joined the formal financial sector in the last decade than any other period in the history of banking.

In the United States, data from the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation shows that while 6 percent of U.S. households (8.4 million) were unbanked in 2017, 18.7 percent of U.S. households (24.2 million) were underbanked.", "tag-4": "In a new study, Banking the Next Billion, Citi estimates that an additional 700-800 million adults will be banked for the first time by the end of 2022, compared to 2017. This staggering change will reduce the total unbanked population to just 15 percent.", "tag-5": "What is driving this unprecedented growth in financial inclusion? Innovative models and technology.", "tag-6": "When asked, people give a whole range of reasons as to why they don't use financial services \u2014 many respond that \"they don't trust banks,\" it's too far to travel to one, it's too difficult to open an account, or they don't have the proper documentation. However, more than 50 percent of the time, the reason they chose to avoid banking was that they did not have enough money to meet the minimum balance requirements or they could not afford the fees and charges that were associated with traditional accounts not designed to address their needs.", "tag-7": "In many countries, regulators are creating new vehicles and licensing processes that have helped improve feasibility for progressive models and accelerate the pace of financial inclusion. These shifts enable new operators, often in partnership with banks, to enter the space. From Bangladesh to Kenya, and Nigeria to Mexico, financial sector business models are using digital solutions to fulfill client needs and transform financial inclusion.", "tag-8": "We believe there are four key approaches on the forefront of this inclusive growth:", "tag-9": "These models are essential to catalysing global inclusive growth.
