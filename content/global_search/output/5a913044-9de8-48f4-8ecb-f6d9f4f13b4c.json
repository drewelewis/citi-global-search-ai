This summer, we introduced the Citi Simplicity\u00ae card, which offers a unique combination: no late fees, no penalty rate, the same rate for both purchases and cash advances, and direct access to a customer service representative.", "tag-4": "We've also heard that you want more options and flexibility with rewards. In response, we introduced new Citi ThankYou\u00ae Cards, which offer unlimited points that never expire. We continue to expand the ways you can use your points, including being able to redeem for travel on any airline at any time with no blackout dates. We've launched an innovative mobile app that allows you to use your points for merchandise at your local Best Buy\u00ae store. Simply scan an item with your mobile phone, pay with your points, and pick it up at the service counter within 15 minutes or less. And we've introduced the ability to share your points with friends and family who are also ThankYou members.", "tag-5": "We're also working to deliver a better online and mobile experience that makes it easier for you to do business with us. We recently introduced a new Citibank for iPad\u00ae app -- recognized as a \"Staff Favorite\" on the App StoreSM -- that lets you manage your credit card and banking accounts while on the go. We've added an online chat feature to help you with things such as registering your account online, added the ability to activate your new Citi card via the Web, and improved our online bill payment capabilities. We're about to launch a redesigned online banking experience that will be both easier to use and provide a wealth of new tools and features to help manage your finances.", "tag-6": "We recognize that you have a choice when it comes to the card you use. While we believe these steps are a good start, we're not stopping here. We remain committed to delivering the products, services and rewards that you deserve, and are focused on earning your business every day.", "tag-7": "EDITOR'S NOTE: Answers to many of the questions posed in the comments section can be found here.", "tag-8": "iPad is a registered trademark of Apple Inc.
