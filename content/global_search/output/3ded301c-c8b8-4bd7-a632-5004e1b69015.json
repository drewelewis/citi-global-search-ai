For those of you with questions related to your account, a member of our Customer Service team will reach out to you via phone or email, if they have not already. We also encourage you to contact us anytime at 1-800-950-5114 or tweet <a href=\"https://twitter.com/askciti\">@AskCiti</a> to let us know how we can address your concerns. <br><br><strong>We appreciate your feedback on improvements to our web site - and where we could do better.</strong> We have already made some improvements to the site design and features and this will continue to be a focus for us in the coming months. Providing reliable access to your account information is a top priority. Sometimes when it takes a page a longer time to load, it is due to measures we have put in place to stop unauthorized traffic to the website and maintain access for customers.
