At the same time, yearend spending growth is slowing and will only amount to 9 percent (as compared to the annual average) for the month (compared to the 25 percent growth seen in December 2012). The most popular spending categories ahead of the holidays are postal and courier services, as well as wine stores and tea shops.", "tag-1": "Russians to Spend More than 90 Billion Rubles on Holiday Gifts in December 2013, According to Citi Analysts", "tag-2": "Moscow \u2013 According to the annual study carried out by Citi's Consumer Banking analysts, the Russian middle class will spend approximately 90 billion rubles in December 2013 on purchases for the New Year holidays. At the same time, yearend spending growth is slowing and will only amount to 9 percent (as compared to the annual average) for the month (compared to the 25 percent growth seen in December 2012). The most popular spending categories ahead of the holidays are postal and courier services, as well as wine stores and tea shops.", "tag-3": "The December budget for middle-class shoppers consists of largely the same core spending categories that are predominant throughout the year. For example, supermarkets and food stores account for 12 percent of spending according to volume, clothing stores account for 11 percent, and airfare and home appliances - 6 percent and 5 percent respectively. At the same time, the seasonal dynamic in these categories is not uniform: some increase or remain close to average while others sharply decline. For example, spending on food products at supermarkets rises 29 percent in December while spending at clothing stores increases 14 percent from the annual average. Meanwhile, the amount of money spent on airfare declines by 17 percent from the monthly average for the year, as the spending peaks for airfare traditionally come in June and October.", "tag-4": "At the same time, there is a sharp rise in the number of uncommon purchases in December that may not have a big impact on consumers' pocketbook but that nonetheless stand out in the month ahead of the holidays. The top seasonal categories this year include the traditional categories of liquor stores (where spending increases 78 percent compared to the monthly average for the year), postal and courier services (up 73 percent) and fitness club memberships (up 73 percent). Also in high demand this time of year are tea and coffee shops (67 percent) and, of course, toy stores (65 percent). The sharpest increase in spending (over 100 percent) is seen at stores which cater to collectors (coin collectors, in particular).", "tag-5": "The share of online sales is forecast to rise 1.4 percent, which is within the normal margin of error. The internet continues to be a popular resource for planning travel: airfare accounts for 33 percent of all online spending in December. Other top categories are tourism agency services (7 percent) and railroad tickets (6 percent). The internet is also a popular means for purchasing home appliances (4 percent of sales volume) and clothing (3 percent) as well as telecom services (4 percent). All of these categories see a seasonal decline in December from the monthly average for year, with the exception of home appliances, where internet sales increase by 30 percent.", "tag-6": "Men's share of internet sales is 55 percent. Furthermore, growth in spending for the month of December among men is nearly twice the growth in spending by women. Analysts also note that the average spend of Russian middle class families in December will be 9 percent higher than for those who have yet to start their own families: the average spend for a man with a family for the month of December is RUB 48,600.", "tag-7": "\"In December we traditionally see the sharpest increase in consumer spending on credit cards. However, this month is also something like a weathervane that reflects consumers' optimism with regards to the coming year. So next year we expect to see more moderate growth, but growth nonetheless in consumer spending,\" said Yuri Topunov, Citi Russia's Consumer Credit Cards Head.", "tag-8": "Ivan Tchakarov, Economist for Citi Russia & CIS, says: \"While the Russian economy has been struggling over the last couple of years, consumer spending has been one relatively bright spot in the Russian macroeconomic environment. Overall, we think that while consumption spending in Russia will remain strong, we see its pace of growth moderating over the next couple of years on the back of higher consumer indebtedness and stricter loan requirements from the banking sector.\"", "tag-9": "Statistical data on credit card spending of Citi's clients served as the basis for this study. The study analyzed the data for the period from the beginning of 2011 until December 2013 with a sample size of at least 500,000 clients selected randomly. The sample only included men and women over the age of 22 with a monthly income of at least RUB 9,000. The forecast for December 2013 was based on analysis of data for the first 11 months of 2013 and took into consideration the statistic trends over the past two years. A presentation of the results is available upon request.", "tag-10": "*The study analyzed spending data in the following Russian cities: Moscow, St. Petersburg, Nizhniy Novgorod, Rostov-on-Don, Volgograd, Samara, Kazan, Yekaterinburg, Novosibirsk and Ufa", "tag-11": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
