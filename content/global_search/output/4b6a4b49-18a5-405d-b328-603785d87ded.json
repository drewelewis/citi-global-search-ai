Seaver said, \"My service as a United States Marine was the single most impactful experience of my life. It taught me the discipline that I needed to succeed as an athlete and the understanding that I could not do it alone, which made me a better team player. That experience shaped my life more than any other.\"", "tag-5": "Following the formal program, the panel stayed for autographs and pictures with audience members.", "tag-6": "There was also a volunteer event on the concourse level of Citi Field that evening before the Mets faced off against the Atlanta Braves.
