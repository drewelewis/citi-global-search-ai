However, few platforms exist for meaningful interaction and resource-sharing among students and educators on issues of global poverty alleviation and financial inclusion. With $450,000 in support from Citi Microfinance, Kiva U aims to fill this gap with a fully built-out education program aimed at significantly broadening Kiva's existing student and educator engagement through three core initiatives:", "tag-5": "Expansion of Campus-Based Microfinance Clubs Kiva Chapters exist at 67 colleges and 60 high schools, and over 2,400 school-based Kiva teams have sprung up. Kiva U aims to leverage this foundation to connect even more students and educators across campuses and around the world with peers who share interests in social enterprise, microfinance, and financial inclusion. The initiative will provide online and offline engagement tools for educators and student organizers, including social sharing for photos, videos and blog posts across multiple social media channels.", "tag-6": "Development of Classroom-Based Curriculum Kiva and Citi have together developed a K-12 and college curriculum around financial inclusion and microfinance and how they play a role in poverty alleviation.

The Summit will host renowned speakers who will lead participants through a deeper dive into poverty and microfinance and equip them with the skills and resources to take action in their classrooms and campuses.", "tag-8": "\"Kiva U will serve as a launching pad for bringing together students and educators who are interested not only in financial inclusion as an abstract concept, but also in how they can use technology and their own resources to make personal connections with those seeking to improve their lives,\" said Bob Annibale, Global Director of Citi Microfinance. \"Broad financial inclusion is dependent on large-scale efforts by the NGO sector, governments and multinationals, but the visceral need is often most evident through the one-on-one connections forged through platforms like Kiva. With Kiva U, we are aiming to advance Kiva's existing efforts among students, provide the necessary tools to connect them with each other and empower them to mobilize their peers around the meaningful act of microlending.\"", "tag-9": "To generate immediate interest in Kiva U, a multi-stage video contest with $30,000 in prizes will ask students to create and submit videos around the theme of how youth can transform the world through microfinance.
