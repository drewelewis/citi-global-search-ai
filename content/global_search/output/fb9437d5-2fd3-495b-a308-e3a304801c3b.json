The program makes use of federal Neighborhood Stabilization Program (NSP) funds received by the City of Los Angeles to create jobs and revitalize neighborhoods.

Most of the Bridges to Business Success Program participants will receive certification by the Southern California Minority Business Development Council thanks to support from Citi, greatly expanding access to contracting opportunities and new capital needed to grow. It is estimated that the program will create 200 new jobs by the end of 2012."}
