Imagine your goal is a portfolio with 60% in U.S. and foreign stocks and 40% in high-quality bonds, certificates of deposit and other conservative investments, and that was the mix you owned at the start of 2012. Even if you haven't done any trading this year, you may now have significantly more than 60% in shares, thanks to the stock market's rise.", "tag-1": "You May Be Unbalanced, Thanks to Rising Share Prices", "tag-2": "It's been a good year for stocks, which means you might want to think about \"rebalancing.\" What's that?

By lightening up on stocks, you'll hurt your portfolio's performance if the market continues to rise, but it'll help if stocks decline from here.", "tag-4": "Rebalancing, however, isn't principally about boosting performance. Rather, it's about managing risk. By rebalancing, whether it is adding to stocks at a market bottom or lightening up on shares during a bull market, you can help your portfolio stay closer to the risk profile you originally settled on. Some investors rebalance at fixed intervals, such as every quarter or every year, while others do so only after big market moves.", "tag-5": "One warning: Rebalancing can mean selling investments with capital gains, so it's best done in a retirement account, where selling won't trigger a tax bill. Even with a retirement account, you should consider the investment costs involved when buying and selling. What if you need to rebalance within a taxable account? To reduce the amount of buying and selling you need to do, you might focus on directing dividends, interest and new savings to those parts of your portfolio that have become underweighted.", "tag-6": "For more from Jonathan Clements, click here.", "tag-7": "INVESTMENT PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022 NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-8": "The information provided is solely for informational purposes.
