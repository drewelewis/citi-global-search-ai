And good morning to all my fellow shareholders who joined us here today, both in New York and by audio-cast.", "tag-3": "First, it feels great to be speaking to you again from the Great Hall of the Cooper Union, an historic 160 year-old building about two miles from our headquarters on Greenwich Street. My management team and I moved there early last year, making a return to our roots in Lower Manhattan after sixty years in midtown.", "tag-4": "Second, it feels fitting to be here because the mission of the Cooper Union, which is \u201cto prepare talented students to make enlightened contributions to society,\u201d is so consistent with Citi\u2019s core mission of enabling growth and economic progress. Peter Cooper, the inventor, investor and innovative philanthropist who founded the Cooper Union, was the son of a poor hatter who amassed a huge fortune despite the disadvantage of having just one year of formal education.", "tag-5": "Cooper founded and funded this unique institution with the goal of helping other young men and women of\u00a0all races\u2014a radical idea at the time\u2014gain the sort of practical education he picked up independently. With The City Bank of New York\u2014our name back then\u2014Cooper helped finance the laying of the first transatlantic cable and the construction of the Panama Canal. Today, in honor of that nearly 200-year-old partnership between two great New York institutions, I\u2019d like to thank Cooper Union\u2019s current president, Laura Sparks, for hosting us here today. Laura is a Citi alumna who during her career at our company worked to develop programs to increase affordable housing and eliminate barriers to opportunity for New York\u2019s low-income families. It\u2019s entirely in keeping with our mutual mission of enabling growth and economic progress for all that at Citi, we recently announced the international expansion of our ground-breaking Pathways to Progress program, with a goal of helping half a million young people inside and outside the U.S. gain the skills necessary to compete in a 21st century economy.", "tag-6": "Our commitment to New York extends beyond the fact that we have our global headquarters here, or that we have more than 17,000 employees and over 25,000 alumni in the metropolitan region. Since our founding not far from here more than two hundred years ago, we\u2019ve been a leading financer of infrastructure in this city and this state. Last year, we helped finance the redevelopment of the Central Terminal at LaGuardia Airport and, before that, the construction of a new Tappan Zee Bridge. Just last year, we financed nearly 10,000 units of affordable housing in New York City and we were ranked the Number One financer of affordable housing in the U.S. for the seventh year in a row.", "tag-7": "These are compelling examples of the critical role Citi plays not just in New York but across the country and the world helping public and private sector entities raise the funding required to build, repair and replace aging infrastructure. At a time when so much infrastructure in the U.S and the world is in dire shape, transformative transactions like these have a significant positive and well-documented \u201cmultiplier effect\u201d on the broader economies of the world, cities, communities and regions. Infrastructure projects, when properly designed, tangibly spur growth, create good jobs and ignite innovation in a virtuous cycle that lies at the heart of what we do at Citi every day.", "tag-8": "I highlight all this because to my mind, too many people in too many countries still don\u2019t appreciate the catalytic impact that we, and companies like ours, can have on the lives of the millions of people and communities we serve. Just think what kind of a world we would live in if the founder of the Cooper Union and the founders of Citi had failed to pursue their grand\u2014yet at the time widely ridiculed\u2014ambitions to stimulate trade between the U.S. and the rest of the world by laying a transatlantic cable and building the Panama Canal.", "tag-9": "Still, those of us who have benefited materially from trade and its cultural cousin, globalization, can\u2019t ignore the fact that trade and globalization haven\u2019t spread their dividends and benefits as widely or evenly as they could, and should. We need to work even harder with both the public and private sectors to make sure that what we do every day helps even more people gain economic security than it does now. Now, if I can, let\u2019s turn to our financial results for the year.", "tag-10": "2016 Results", "tag-11": "I\u2019d say it\u2019s no exaggeration that 2016 was an extremely eventful year for our company, our country and the world. As the year progressed from one with a first half defined by economic anxiety and volatility to a second half impacted by a series of political upsets and surprises, at Citi we demonstrated the resilience of our unique global franchise. Our support and advice helped millions of customers and clients around the world navigate an environment that turned out to be far more challenging than anticipated.", "tag-12": "The nearly $15 billion in net income we earned in 2016 was a reflection of the momentum we built across many of our core businesses over the year, even as we made the investments needed to spur growth. Among the many milestones we marked on the road to achieving our ultimate goal of being an indisputably strong and stable institution, I\u2019d like to highlight a few:", "tag-13": "First, in our\u00a0consumer bank, we continued to focus our footprint with the announcement of plans to divest our consumer businesses in Argentina, Brazil and Colombia. We made those difficult decisions to concentrate our finite resources on our three major consumer markets: the U.S., Mexico and Asia.", "tag-14": "In the U.S., one of the highlights of the year was the conversion of 11 million Costco credit card customers to our platform in June, and then adding an additional 1 million new cardholders over the next six months. We also extended a nearly three-decade-long relationship with American Airlines and renewed an important partnership with The Home Depot. And in Mexico, where we enjoy the benefits of scale and a strong market position, we rebranded our franchise\u00a0Citibanamex\u00a0and embarked on a multi-year $1 billion investment program aimed at modernizing our branches and upgrading our technology. We maintained that investment while reaffirming our longstanding commitment to our North American neighbor, and confidence in its growth prospects.", "tag-15": "We also made progress in our consumer bank meeting the evolving needs of our customers by accelerating our mobile-first digital strategy. Our FinTech unit spearheaded the first mobile app combining banking, wealth management and money management, demonstrating not just the strength of the strategy but the agile methodology we used to move this innovation to markets quickly. And in Asia, we entered into promising partnerships with the ride-hailing platform Grab, hospitality pioneer Airbnb and the Lazada Group, a leading e-commerce site.", "tag-16": "In our\u00a0institutional business, we continued to gain market and wallet share with our target clients as revenues rose 10 percent in total for the year for Fixed Income and Equities. Our industry-leading Treasury and Trade Solutions business, the largest proprietary closed-loop mover of money in the world, generated year-over-year revenue growth for the third consecutive year, despite the low-interest rate environment. Our #1 ranking in the Greenwich Associates survey confirmed we remain the clear leader in fixed income. And I\u2019m proud to add that our market shares in both fixed-income and equities have risen to their highest point since the crisis.", "tag-17": "Our bankers further distinguished themselves by advising on 10 transactions worth $140 billion in a single week. Being named \u201cBank of the Year\u201d by the influential\u00a0International Financing Review\u00a0was another recognition of our industry-leading position.", "tag-18": "As importantly, we continued to make progress in our journey to being a simpler, smaller, safer and stronger institution. With non-core assets in Citi Holdings now down to 3 percent of our balance sheet, we announced we would no longer report Holdings results separately after the fourth quarter of last year. The significance of that announcement cannot, in my view, be overstated, considering that at its peak Holdings had more than $800 billion in assets and was capable of producing multi-billion dollar losses in a single quarter. In contrast, Holdings\u2019 final quarter was its\u00a010th profitable one in a row. The passage of Holdings into history signals more clearly than any other event I can think of that to a significant degree, we\u2019ve put the crisis behind us.", "tag-19": "Yet another sign that we can now focus more on our future than on our past was the welcome announcement that we were the\u00a0only one of eight\u00a0U.S. banks determined by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve to have no deficiencies in our Resolution and Recovery Plan. We also made tangible progress generating the kind of returns you expect and deserve. In 2016, we returned nearly $11 billion in capital to you, including the impact of the incremental increase of $1.8 billion we announced in November.", "tag-20": "All those milestones and achievements support what constitutes our boldest headline of the year:\u00a0Our restructuring is over.", "tag-21": "What I mean by that is that we have returned to our roots as a globally-focused bank with just two businesses, which are appropriately scaled to serve with distinction a discrete set of customers and clients. We define those core customers and clients as those most likely to benefit from our unique global network and footprint. And we continue to believe, with persuasive evidence to support it, that our model is the right one, at the right time, to perform well in this current environment.", "tag-22": "Yet, despite those very real accomplishments and signs of progress, we recognize that with respect to the goals and targets we set for ourselves a few years ago, our performance last year fell short. Specifically, our\u00a0net income\u00a0dropped\u00a0from\u00a0$17 billion\u00a0in\u00a02015\u00a0to\u00a0$15 billion\u00a0last year; our\u00a0Efficiency Ratio\u00a0rose to\u00a059\u00a0percent from\u00a057\u00a0percent, our\u00a0Return on Assets\u00a0decreased\u00a0from\u00a095\u00a0basis points to\u00a082\u00a0basis points last year, and our\u00a0Return on Tangible Common Equity\u00a0declined\u00a0from\u00a09.3\u00a0percent in\u00a02015\u00a0to\u00a07.6\u00a0percent last year. Why?", "tag-23": "Mostly, because early last year, despite the volatility and turbulence we saw in the markets, we decided to push ahead with previously-announced plans to make targeted investments in Cards, Equities, Mexico, Treasury and Transaction Services, Citigold, and much-needed infrastructure and technology across our franchise. We also saw smaller gains on asset sales in Citi Holdings, which further reduced our top-line results.", "tag-24": "That said, we have a clear path to producing better returns in the future. And we\u2019ve divided that path into three drivers that lie mainly within our control.", "tag-25": "First, our\u00a0raw earnings power.", "tag-26": "This first driver mainly consists of our client engagement and wallet share growth, combined with the monetization of our investments, while continuing to improve our efficiency through simplification, digitization and expense discipline.", "tag-27": "Second, our\u00a0capital base optimization.", "tag-28": "This second driver mainly consists of continuing to wind down our non-core assets, continuing to utilize our Deferred Tax Assets while reducing the amount of capital we need to support them and continuing to return as much regulatory capital to you as we can above the amount we need to prudently operate and invest in our businesses.", "tag-29": "Third, our\u00a0operating environment.", "tag-30": "This third driver mainly consists of the expected upward trajectory of the Federal Funds Rate, which has been gradually rising, as predicted, this year with one additional rate hike and at least one other regarded as likely.", "tag-31": "Earlier this year, we backed up our conviction that we can\u2014and will\u2014execute strongly against all three growth drivers by laying out updated financial targets.", "tag-32": "Including\u2026", "tag-33": "A 10 percent Return on Tangible Common Equity excluding our disallowed Deferred Tax Assets in 2018 and a 10 percent Return on Tangible Common Equity including our Deferred Tax Assets in 2019. And we believe we are capable as a franchise of generating a 14 percent Return on Tangible Common Equity over the longer term. Fortunately, our recently-announced first quarter results reinforce that conviction.", "tag-34": "1Q 2017 Results", "tag-35": "A little less than two weeks ago we reported earnings of $4.1 billion, or $1.35 per share. We carried momentum in many of our businesses from the end of last year into the quarter, leading to significantly better performance compared to one year ago. We grew loans and deposits and achieved an efficiency ratio of just under 58 percent, a Return on Assets of 91 basis points and a Return on Tangible Common Equity, excluding our Deferred Tax Assets, of over 10 percent, in line with the near-term targets I just mentioned.", "tag-36": "Turning to our two core businesses, in global consumer banking our U.S. cards business continued to benefit from the acquisition of the Costco portfolio, although we did see lower U.S. mortgage volumes and revenues. Internationally, we again posted revenue growth and positive operating leverage in Asia and Mexico, and we continued our investment plan in Mexico to drive improved efficiency and returns.", "tag-37": "Our institutional business also enjoyed a strong quarter all-around, as we continue to gain both wallet and market share across our target client segments. Our markets businesses performed very well, with revenue up 17 percent year-over-year, comprised of a 19 percent increase in Fixed Income and a 10 percent increase in Equities, another area we\u2019ve been strategically investing in.", "tag-38": "From a capital planning perspective, we utilized another $800 million in Deferred Tax Assets, contributing to the generation of $5.5 billion of regulatory capital in the quarter, before returning $2.2 billion to our shareholders. We increased our Tangible Book Value per share to $65.94\u20145 percent higher than a year ago and 14 percent higher than two years ago\u2014and we raised our Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio to 12.8 percent.", "tag-39": "That means we clearly have excess capital, which we couldn\u2019t be more committed to returning to you at the earliest possible opportunity. When we submitted our capital plan for the 2017 CCAR cycle recently, you can be sure we made the case that we\u2019ve made good and steady progress in strengthening our firm.", "tag-40": "So as we continue to boost both our core businesses and see the positive results of the investments we\u2019ve been making for growth, our confidence in the viability of our global model and network has, if anything, only increased. Our global network is uniquely situated to helping our clients\u2014many of which are here in the U.S., and the non-U.S. multinationals we serve in dozens of countries\u2014navigate the current environment, whether through supply chain optimization, our advisory capabilities or trade finance.", "tag-41": "Which means we have the right model, the right strategy, the right customers and clients, and the right people in the right places to meet our updated targets. And in you, we have investors who appreciate the power, the promise and potential we have to become the world\u2019s best global bank.", "tag-42": "Yet if we\u2019re going to realize that ambition, we must demonstrate that we are continuing to fulfill our mission of enabling growth and economic progress. In support of that goal, I\u2019m proud to say that we\u2019ve made significant progress toward our $100 Billion Environmental Finance Goal, with $26.3 billion recorded in 2016. And because we\u2019re on track to achieve that goal this year according to how we\u2019ve been tracking our activity to date, we challenged ourselves to redefine what completion means and have adopted a league table-based methodology that counts only Citi\u2019s share of a transaction as opposed to\u00a0total deal value. Applying this new methodology, our overall environmental finance activity since 2014 comes to $41.2 billion. These measures reflect both our commitment to addressing climate change through our business activities and a willingness to learn and adapt to the field of environmental finance as it continues to evolve.", "tag-43": "In conclusion, I can honestly say that in my fifth year as Citi\u2019s leader, I couldn\u2019t be prouder or happier to work for a company that goes to such lengths to fulfill its Mission and Value Proposition, to responsibly provide financial services that enable growth and economic progress. After almost a decade of transformation, I\u2019m happy to report that as of April 2017, Citi is in a position to scale new heights. And I couldn\u2019t be more grateful to everyone here\u2014and around the world\u2014for supporting us on this journey.", "tag-44": "Thank you for the opportunity to share these thoughts with you today."}
