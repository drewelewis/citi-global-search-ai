This growth will be reflected in corporate earnings in 2024 (+4%) and 2025 (+8%) and will benefit the broader stock market.", "tag-4": "Citi Global Wealth is also forecasting a low likelihood of a recession in 2024 and predicts that \u00a0\u201crolling recessions\u201d in certain industries and sectors will fade in 2024 as markets for goods and services normalize.", "tag-5": "\u201cMarkets lead economies,\u201d said David Bailin, Chief Investment Officer at Citi Global Wealth. \u201cThe \u2018big reset\u2019 reflects our view that higher strategic returns will be available over the decade and for many investors, may prove to be a time when fully invested, diversified core portfolios can capture market results across equities and bonds.\u201d", "tag-6": "The \u201cbig reset\u201d will occur in a synchronous manner in both equity and bond markets. Investors should avoid sitting on the sidelines waiting for a signal to re-invest which is unlikely to occur.", "tag-7": "With the U.S. Federal Reserve perhaps done hiking interest rates, Citi Global Wealth also suggests locking in potentially higher yields on bonds now. With bond yields materially higher than they were just two years ago, intermediate bonds may add more value to portfolios than cash over the years to come. The Federal Reserve will likely lower short-term interest rates as inflation eases to prevent a higher unemployment rate.", "tag-8": "\u201cWe believe in balanced, \u201ccore\u201d portfolios,\u201d said Steven Wieting, Chief Investment Strategist and Chief Economist at Citi Global Wealth. \u201cWe have also outlined some opportunistic strategies that include undervalued assets and areas where a catalyst for growth or change in market conditions exist. These include investments related to our long-term unstoppable trends, including longevity and the impact of artificial intelligence.\u201d", "tag-9": "For the first time, the Full-Year Outlook includes Citi Global Wealth\u2019s top 10 opportunistic investment ideas:", "tag-10": "See Citi Global Wealth\u2019s Outlook report for full details.", "tag-11": "About Citi", "tag-12": "Citi is a preeminent banking partner for institutions with cross-border needs, a global leader in wealth management and a valued personal bank in its home market of the United States.
