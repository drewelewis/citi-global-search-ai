The new service stands out for the holistic approach it adopts towards the investment advisory process that also takes into account the risks that these individuals face in the businesses they own or run. CEO Conversations, unique in the private wealth management arena in Singapore, is the latest enhancement to Citibank's Citigold Private Client segment catering to clients with liquid assets of S$1 million and above.", "tag-4": "Mr. Han Kwee Juan, Chief Executive Officer for Citibank Singapore Limited, said: \"Entrepreneurship is an important source of wealth for affluent clients who want more sophisticated and effective solutions to grow their assets. The need for such a differentiated service emerged as part of the learnings that we draw from regular engagement with our clients in the Citigold Private Client segment. Specifically, conversations with clients who are business owners or senior executives with equity in their companies revealed that there may be a tendency for them to also invest their personal wealth in similar industries or sectors. While they have intimate knowledge of the industry, such investment behavior has the potential to result in an uneven distribution of exposures to particular asset classes, sectors, industries or geographies.\"", "tag-5": "CEO Conversations addresses this by harnessing risk management tools that provide clients with insight into how their businesses trend against a range of industries and asset classes. With such an understanding, clients are better equipped to make an informed decision on the assets or sectors they place their personal investments into in order to mitigate any downside risks they face in their businesses.", "tag-6": "The launch of CEO Conversations at this juncture is a timely one, given the rising contribution of business ownership as a source of wealth for the affluent in Singapore. According to a 2012 Asia Pacific Wealth Report by Capgemini, entrepreneurship and commerce are significant drivers of wealth amongst HNW individuals with a net worth of US$1 million and above. In particular, the report noted that 57 percent of HNW wealth in Asia is derived from business ownership. In Singapore, it is estimated that almost 40 percent of the country's onshore HNW client base accumulated their wealth through business ownership - either a business that they set up or one that they have come to manage through their family.1", "tag-7": "Mr. Han added, \"This new service reflects Citigold Private Client's holistic approach to wealth management, as we are going beyond just managing our clients' personal wealth, to recognizing that their business portfolios account for a significant portion of their wealth and should be considered in their asset allocation strategy.\"", "tag-8": "Clients can request for the service through a Citigold Private Client Relationship Manager who will first seek to understand the nature of the client's business, the risks it faces and how it trends in relation to various sectors and asset classes. Recommendations are then made according to the client's personal risk profile.", "tag-9": "In addition to the enhanced advisory process, CEO Conversations also provides clients with a suite of privileges that is aimed at helping them build and grow their businesses. These include:", "tag-10": "\"Many entrepreneurs and C-level executives tell us they are too busy running their business to think about personal investments, so most of their wealth is invested back into their business. As their business is an asset class in itself, it is prudent for them to have a personal investment portfolio that recognizes the exposures they face in their businesses, helping to diversify their risk and to provide for personal needs such as retirement and their children's' education,\" said Mr. Han. \"By looking at both their personal and business assets, we can help to ensure their personal wealth grows in tandem with their business success.\"", "tag-11": "CEO Conversations fits in with the Citigold Private Client proposition to offer a holistic wealth management service, with the sophistication of solutions growing in tandem with the affluence of clients.", "tag-12": "Citigold Private Client", "tag-13": "Citigold Private Client (\"CPC\") serves customers with investible assets of between S$1 million to US$10 million, with a unique proposition that offers the sophistication of private wealth solutions with the convenience of retail banking facilities.", "tag-14": "Citibank Singapore Limited first recognized the need for a dedicated wealth management service for this segment in 2008, when Citigold Select was launched to provide high net worth clients with highly personalized and holistic portfolio management.

The 2012 Asia Pacific Wealth Report by Capgemini estimated that there are currently some 91,000 people in Singapore with investible assets of US$1 million and above. Furthermore, Singapore has the most number of U.S. dollar millionaires per capita \u2013 almost one in six \u2013 of any country in Asia Pacific, the report noted. The liquid assets of this segment are also anticipated to grow approximately 40 percent in the next three years. 2 Our Citigold Private Client customer base and the assets under management (\"AUM\") have grown in tandem with the market and seen strong growth in the past three years. Since its launch in 2010, we have seen an increase of about 40 percent in the number of new Citigold Private Client customers as well as in AUM for the segment.", "tag-17": "Service and Delivery Model", "tag-18": "Team based approach: Clients are served by a dedicated Citigold Private Client Relationship Manager and Service Manager, together with a team of financial experts including Treasury, Equity and Investment Specialists, Portfolio Counselors and Business Bankers.", "tag-19": "Personalized service: Senior bankers have been handpicked to serve clients who will enjoy a high degree of customer contact and customization in advice and solutions provided.", "tag-20": "Clients can make use of these services at our two Citigold Private Client Centers located at Paragon Shopping Centre and Capital Square.", "tag-21": "Products and Services", "tag-22": "Citigold Private Clients have access to an expansive range of products and services that are offered by businesses across Citi.
