The report will examine this national topic through a Missouri initiative on the ballot this fall that seeks to limit annual loan percentage rates to 36%. Supporters of the initiative point out that the average payday loan carries an annual percentage rate of 444% (with some running as high as 1,900%) and say the initiative is needed to stop lenders from trapping the working poor in a cycle of debt.

It's a compelling topic sure to provoke much debate.", "tag-4": "The Citi Foundation believes that helping people understand how to manage money wisely and use financial services to plan and save for the future is critically important to achieve financial stability and inclusion. \"Your Money and Your Life\" takes an unvarnished view at the real-world challenges and the potential pathways forward."}
