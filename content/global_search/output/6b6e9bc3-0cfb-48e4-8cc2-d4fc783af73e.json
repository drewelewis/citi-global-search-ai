This increase was partially offset by a revenue reduction from the closed exits and wind-downs within Legacy Franchises.", "tag-7": "Third quarter results included divestiture-related impacts of $299 million5 in earnings before taxes ($214 million after-tax), primarily driven by a gain on the sale of the Taiwan consumer business, recorded in Legacy Franchises.

Services, our fastest growing business, grew by 13% with Treasury and Trade Solutions having its best quarter in a decade. Markets was up 10% driven by strength in Fixed Income. Banking activity played to our mix and grew 17%, bolstered by a rebound in debt issuance and some signs of life in the equity capital markets. U.S. Personal Banking also had double-digit revenue growth while a continued deceleration in spending indicates an increasingly cautious consumer. And Wealth revenues grew as the business continues to win new mandates and acquire new clients.\u00a0\u201cOur CET1 ratio grew to 13.5% which is $14 billion above our current regulatory minimum after returning $1.5 billion to our shareholders through common dividends and share repurchases. Our discipline of growing operating deposits has enabled us to maintain a stable deposit base. Taken with our high-quality asset portfolio, strong reserve levels, ample liquidity and diversified earnings base, we are proving to our clients that we truly are a bank for all seasons.\u00a0\u201cLast month we announced consequential changes that align our organizational structure with our strategy and changes how we run the bank.
