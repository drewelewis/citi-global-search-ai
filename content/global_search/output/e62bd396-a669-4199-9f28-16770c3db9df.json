More than 200 people received individual consultations from experts in ecotourism and financial management in the tourism business.", "tag-4": "In total, 92 applications were received for the microloan competition, from which 40 projects were supported. The total amount of all interest-free loans issued exceeded 1.5 million rubles. The process of gathering applications for the interest-free loan competition in Tuva was wrapped up in early September.", "tag-5": "Journalists from Europe, America, Russia and Asia visited the districts and villages that participated in the program this year. An exhibition of projects took place in Inya, where villagers presented their achievements in the organization of \"green\" homes, the production of souvenirs based on local handicrafts, the creation of village hotels, organization of food services and excursions. Journalists appreciated the diversity of souvenir products based on the traditional arts and crafts of the Altai and enjoyed a presentation of a unique collection of clothing made of felt created by Altai masters. They were also treated to a performance of the renowned throat singing of the Altai people.", "tag-6": "The program began in 2011. During the first stage, 580 people completed the training course and 150 of them subsequently participated in a business plan contest. Thirty business plans were then chosen for financing in the form of micro-grants totaling 1.3 million rubles.", "tag-7": "The development of green tourism was chosen as a priority focus for the program for rural residents of the Altai Mountains as this is perhaps the most promising area for economic development. Taking into account the high level of unemployment in the Altai Republic, the development of rural (green) tourism in the Altai Mountains is often the only source of income for local people. Residents are counting on making a living from their services in the organization of green guest houses, excursions, arts and craft studios, transportation and horse rentals, ethno-shops and museums \u2013 what they can do by putting their hands and minds to work. Such efforts do not require major investments, but they must be done well and be underpinned by good ideas.", "tag-8": "Entrepreneurs' stories:", "tag-9": "Evgeny Konushev The development of eco and rural tourism in the Ulagansky district is gaining speed with each passing year. The renowned Katu-Yaryk Pass in the Altai Mountains can see over 100 passenger vehicles with tourists en route to the Chulyshman Valley every day. This area is located within the zone of cooperation of the Altai Biosphere Preserve and the Ak Chlosha Nature Park was recently established here. Evgeny Konushev, a resident of the village of Ulagan, proposed to organize an ecotourism stopover site. The idea caught the attention of the program coordinators as this makes it possible to maintain order and keep the area clean as well as to provide tourists with various services \u2013 sampling local cuisine, purchasing souvenirs and receiving comprehensive information about tourist routes in the Chulyshman Valley. Over the course of the short summer season at Katu-Yaryk Pass, Evgeny built a traditional Altai 'ail' house, which in the future will serve as an ecotourism stopover.", "tag-10": "Albina Takina \"Our village of Tyungur has always been visited by tourists and the main issue for them of course is food. I built my own caf\u00e9 in the village, prepare traditional Altai dishes and organize horse rentals. For a long time I had considered the organization of guest houses and setting up a parking lot, but didn't have enough money for it. After learning about program in support of rural tourism in our district, I decided to participate in the contest and received money for setting up stops on the tourist route. I bought construction materials using the money. I think that now we can provide proper recreation services for tourists. The program became a new starting point for my business.\"", "tag-11": "More about the program and results from 2011", "tag-12": "The uniqueness of the program is its environmental conservation component. Experts from Citi Foundation and the WWF hope that preserving nature by raising the standard of living of local residents through the development of entrepreneurship will steer them away from poaching and unsustainable harvesting of natural resource. Such environmental conservation methods have been successfully used in many countries throughout the world.", "tag-13": "Analysis of the results from the 2011 program has shown that the 30 programs that received support have proven to be sustainable; new jobs were created; the total value of goods and services produced and rendered by participants of the program in September through to December 2011 alone totaled 751,000 rubles. Through the sale of their products participants received approximately 300,000 in additional income.", "tag-14": "The amazingly rich flora and fauna, landscape, cultural and historical diversity create a strong draw for tourists to the Altai Republic. In the summer of 2012, tourist traffic to the region increased by 12 percent (1.35 million visits), and the local government predicts this number to double by 2020. Considering the lack of industrial potential and the pressing need to preserve the pristine nature of the region, ecotourism is considered the most promising way to improve the standards of living of residents, more than 90 percent of whom reside in rural areas.", "tag-15": "Additional information", "tag-16": "The Altai Republic has a population of over 200,000 people, the majority of which are engaged in animal husbandry and live and work in the Altai Mountains and steppe. One of the biggest problems impeding the development of remote Russian regions such as Altai is unemployment, which in some villages in the region reaches 90 percent. As a result, the standards of living for rural residents are very low, and the income of many herder families is only $1,000-2,000 a year. These factors contribute to the proliferation of poaching and the trade of plants and animals, which directly threatens the region's biodiversity. This is why to ensure the protection of Altai's unique natural wildlife standards of living of rural communities should be improved and alternative opportunities for the local population to generate income are needed.", "tag-17": "The Altai Republic has a unique landscape and biological and cultural diversity: more than 2,000 plant species, over 80 animal species and in excess of 350 birds species can be found in the republic as well as a whole host of historical and cultural monuments. In the Altai Mountains there are two biosphere reserves, one national park, five natural parks and two nature reserves. More than 20 percent of the republic is environmentally protected land. The republic also boasts the Golden Mountains of Altai, a UNESCO world heritage site. The Altai Mountains are home to the world's largest populations of snow leopards and Altai mountain sheep (argali), which are both included in Russia's Red Book of rare and endangered wildlife.", "tag-18": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
