Instead of making billions of cash payments, including disbursements of salaries, payments to vendors, pensions, social welfare stipends, cash-for-work programs, and emergency relief payments, these large payers can tap into existing payment systems to move money electronically. In doing so, they not only will unlock access to financial services for millions of people, they will also realize increased cost savings, transparency, and security.", "tag-5": "CARE USA", "tag-6": "USAID,"}
