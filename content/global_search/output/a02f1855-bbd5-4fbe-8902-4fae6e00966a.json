After all, retirement-account withdrawals are typically taxed as ordinary income, which can mean paying a federal rate as high as 35%. By contrast, in a taxable account, any qualifying dividends and long-term capital gains are taxed at a maximum federal rate of 15%.", "tag-1": "Funding Retirement Accounts", "tag-2": "Some people are reluctant to fund Individual Retirement Accounts and 401(k) plans, fearing they are setting themselves up for big tax bills in retirement.

By contrast, in a taxable account, any qualifying dividends and long-term capital gains are taxed at a maximum federal rate of 15%.", "tag-3": "What to do? If you're eligible, you can always fund a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) instead. Roth accounts don't offer an initial tax deduction, but withdrawals can be federal and state tax-free if you follow the rules.", "tag-4": "But even if the Roth isn't an option, a tax-deductible IRA or 401(k) remains a fine choice. That's because the initial tax deduction often pays for the eventual tax bill. To understand why, consider a simple example. Suppose you are in the 25% federal income-tax bracket today--and you're still in the 25% bracket once you retire. If you put $1,000 in a tax-deductible IRA, your out-of-pocket cost would be $750, thanks to the $250 tax savings.", "tag-5": "By the time you retire, let's assume your IRA has grown a hypothetical 100% to $2,000 (though there are, of course, no guarantees). At that juncture, you cash out the account, paying 25% to the government. That leaves you with $1,500, or 100% more than your $750 investment. In effect, the IRA gave you tax-free growth on your initial $750 out-of-pocket cost.", "tag-6": "To be sure, if you are in a higher tax bracket in retirement, you won't enjoy totally tax-free growth. On the other hand, if your tax bracket falls in retirement--which often happens--you will benefit at Uncle Sam's expense.", "tag-7": "INVESTMENT PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022 NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-8": "Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates do not provide tax or legal advice.
