But there are ways to supercharge your retirement savings. Here are 5 ideas to consider: <br><br>1. Make time your friend. Starting early and saving consistently is the best gift you can give your future self. The earlier you start, the more money you have working for you (through compounding) and the more you can potentially earn. <br><br>2. Do the math. Take advantage of online retirement calculators to help you think through your retirement goals and how to fund them. Your bank probably offers one, and you also may want to check out calculators from <a href=\"https://www.choosetosave.org/ballpark/\">Choose to Save </a>and <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/work/retirement-planning/retirement_calculator/\">AARP</a>.
