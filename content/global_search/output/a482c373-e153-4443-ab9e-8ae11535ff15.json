(MCPI) in ceremonies held at Hyatt Hotel.

(MCPI) in ceremonies held at Hyatt Hotel. Three microentrepreneurs from Luzon, two from Visayas and one from Mindanao bested more than 100 nominees and received P700,000 in cash prizes as well as scholarships for entrepreneurial training and three-year microinsurance coverage.", "tag-4": "CMA also recognized 12 other microentrepreneurs who qualified as semi-finalists in this year's search, and each received a plaque and P10,000. Meanwhile, the microfinance institution (MFI) partners and loan officers of the six winners were also awarded plaques and P10,000 each.", "tag-5": "Funded by Citi Foundation, CMA was launched in 2002 as part of the celebrations for Citi's 100th year in the Philippines. The program recognizes outstanding entrepreneurs who have assets of P3 million or less and have achieved remarkable growth as indicated by employment generation, profits and sales turnover as well as contributed to community development.", "tag-6": "All these criteria were clearly met by this year's national winner Floraiwin Cainglet. She started with two piglets in 2004, and now manages a P2.5 million business with her husband Rommel. The couple's use of innovative technologies, including an automatic feeder for swine and use for biogas, reduced their operating costs and increased productivity.", "tag-7": "In his welcome remarks, Citi Country Officer Sanjiv Vohra underscored the importance of access to microcredit. \"Microfinance and microenterprise play an important role in the development of any economy and society. In the last decade, we have recognized and awarded nearly 90 outstanding Filipino microentrepreneurs, many of whom have been able to use the awards as a boost to becoming sustainable enterprises that are not only providing opportunities for themselves, but for their families and community. If there is one aspect about this program that makes Citi very proud, it is the fact that it shows that access to microfinance is truly adding real measurable value to local communities.\"", "tag-8": "Without access to microcredit, regional winners Milagros Hiyas (Luzon), Abella de Dios (Visayas), and Rabia Mangumping (Mindanao), would not have been able to realize their dreams and provide for their families. Milagros' rattan furniture business now owns three shops with 16 workers. Abella's burger joint has become a full-blown buffet bar and restaurant with as many as 15 workers during peak season, while Rabia's dress shop for Muslim brides has grown to a P2.3 million enterprise. Special awardees for social innovation, Marilyn Fajardo and Lenieflor Ico, also showed remarkable drive and success starting with almost nothing. Marilyn was selling cosmetics and now owns a fleet of pedicabs with 41 drivers, many of whom are ex-convicts to whom she wanted to give a second chance at improving their lives. Lenieflor had only P100 in capital when she began her icing flower candies business, and she now enjoys sales of more than P3 million.", "tag-9": "BSP Governor Amando Tetangco was the keynote speaker, and he said: \"The effective partnership between Citi, MCPI and the BSP has allowed us to provide a fitting venue to highlight the exceptional stories of our country's industrious and resilient microentrepreneurs. Today, as we mark our 10th year of cooperation, we celebrate this strong testament of the importance of client focus in microfinance.", "tag-10": "Tetangco and Vohra serve as co-chairpersons of the National Selection Committee that determined this year's winners. The other judges included industry and community leaders such as former Monetary Board member Antonino Alindogan, Jr., Ayala Corporation President and COO Fernando Zobel de Ayala, RFM Corporation President and CEO Jose Concepcion III, GMA Network Chairman Atty. Felipe Gozon, Robinsons Retail Group President and COO Robina Gokongwei-Pe, Philippine Daily Inquirer chairperson Marixi Prieto, and Ateneo de Manila University Professor Dr. Darwin Yu.", "tag-11": "The affair also served as a venue to launch the CMA Alumni Network, as BSP, Citi and MCPI work hand-in-hand to further support and strengthen the businesses of the men and women they have awarded over the last 10 years.", "tag-12": "In announcing the CMA Alumni Network, MCPI Chairperson Mila Mercado-Bunker said, \"With the launch of the CMA Alumni Network, the winners receive an intangible prize \u2013 that feeling of belonging to the circle of the most outstanding microentrepreneurs in the country. The Alumni Network will link and bring back the winners together to interact, learn from, and share with fellow role models the knowledge and experiences in the pursuit of continuously improving their businesses.\"", "tag-13": "Some of the newly-inducted members to the CMA Alumni Network were feted in a commemorative book entitled Small Steps to Success. This publication was intended to celebrate the 10 years of CMA and feature 10 inspiring stories of economic heroism.", "tag-14": "\"As we celebrate the 10th year of CMA, we hope that this program will continue to highlight the success stories of poor Filipinos who, through microfinance, were able to rise above poverty by relying on hard work, perseverance and innovation. Microentrepreneurs are the new hope of this generation and the force that will take this nation to new heights. Citi remains steadfast in its support of the CMA, and we consider our investment in this program as one way in which we can contribute to the development of the Philippine economy,\" concluded Vohra.", "tag-15": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
