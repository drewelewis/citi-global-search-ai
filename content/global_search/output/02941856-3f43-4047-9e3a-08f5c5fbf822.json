These included: consolidating operations into one central unit; significantly reinforcing the size and training of our staff; and, tightening control processes, including limiting the ability to sign-off on initiation of the foreclosure processes to internal Citi personnel only. These actions were in addition to our ongoing efforts since 2007 to improve our mortgage servicing and loss mitigation processes, including the implementation of a variety of government and proprietary loss mitigation programs.", "tag-4": "\"Following a recent review by federal banking regulators of the residential mortgage loan servicing and foreclosure-related practices of the 14 major U.S. residential mortgage servicers, Citi and the 13 other institutions entered into Consent Orders. These Orders demand both consistency and a higher set of standards across the industry. We are committed to working with our regulators to further strengthen our programs in these areas and meeting these new requirements by the implementation deadlines. At the same time, we will continue our ongoing efforts to help families in financial distress, and in particular, to help families avoid foreclosure and stay in their homes.\"", "tag-5": "Citi Citi, the leading global financial services company, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
