If an insurer feels carrying a hefty amount of debt might impact your health, it might even ask you to pay more for life insurance.", "tag-5": "Insurance companies are required to notify you if credit information leads to an adverse action, such as cancelling or denying coverage, reducing your coverage or raising your premiums.
