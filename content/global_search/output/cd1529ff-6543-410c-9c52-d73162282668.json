Some of the key points:", "tag-3": "At Citi, we look for ways to make our company's operational footprint more environmentally sustainable, while also engaging with our clients to encourage best practices. Among our achievements:", "tag-4": "Citi finances economic development in communities and countries around the world. We understand that with that economic development come real environmental and social complexities, which require deep understanding, capacity, and dedication to work through and resolve. Whether it is by greening our facilities, talking to our clients about tough issues, or pushing forward important projects that accelerate a conversion to renewable power sources, such as wind, Citi is committed to sustainability as a central tenet of Responsible Finance.", "tag-5": "In the period leading up to Earth Week, many Citi facilities also took an active stand to raise awareness about climate change, going dark for Earth Hour. At the appointed local time, 8:30PM on Saturday, March 26, we powered down 736 Citi buildings in 63 countries -- from Australia to Zambia and including New York, London, Hong Kong and Sao Paolo.", "tag-6": "These before-and-after photos of Citibank Center and Citibank Tower in Makati City, Philippines illustrate the difference that lights-out makes. Our regional City Realty Services managers often compete to see whose region will have the most facilities participating. At Citi, we see it as a fun way to show our commitment to something that we work on every day -- reducing our impact on the environment."}
