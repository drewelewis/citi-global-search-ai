Time is the most valuable asset for busy Filipino cardholders who no longer have to wait in long queues or fumble with cash or coins.

Retailers will benefit from faster checkouts, reduced queuing and lowering cash handling costs,\" said Jamieson.", "tag-9": "With the new Citibank Visa payWave, cardholders can simply wave their cards in front of a payWave reader to pay for their goods.

On average, payWave transactions can be up to three times faster than cash payments, reducing queuing times for both cardholders and retailers and all with the added benefit that the payWave card does not leave the cardholder's hand.", "tag-10": "Consumer Business Manager for Citi Philippines Bea Tan is confident that their cardholders will embrace the new technology. \"We understand our customers and know the demands on their time and how their lifestyles are changing.
