The program, supported by a grant from Citi Community Development, was developed by CredAbility, a national nonprofit credit counseling organization, in collaboration with each of these established veterans' service organizations.", "tag-4": "Recent data shows that members of the armed forces, veterans and their families face particular financial difficulties. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the unemployment rate for veterans who have served on active duty since September 2001 was 12.1 percent in 2011, compared to the national unemployment rate of 8.9 percent that same year.

And active duty servicemembers might want to create a financial support plan for spouses and children during times of deployment or transfer, or in the event of a loss that leaves them financially vulnerable. CredAbility ReConnect will provide the education and counseling to show them how to accomplish these personal finance goals.\"", "tag-9": "\"Every member of the armed forces has sacrificed a great deal in service to their country, and in addition to the challenges of military service, many face tremendous financial pressures as well,\" said Suni Harford, Citi's Regional Head of Markets for North America. \"These brave men and women receive extensive military training, but far too few of them receive any kind of formal financial education.
