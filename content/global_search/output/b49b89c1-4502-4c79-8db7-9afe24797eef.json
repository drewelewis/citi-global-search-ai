That certainly keeps things simple: You have less paperwork, it's easier to start and stop the business without legal expenses, and you don't have to pay taxes as a corporation. You just fill out Schedule C with your federal tax return and you're done.", "tag-1": "Small businesses, big choices.", "tag-2": "If you own a small business, you might have started it as a sole proprietorship.

If you are sued, your home and investments may be at risk. As a result, many small-business owners consider adopting one of two basic legal structures: the LLC or the S-Corp.", "tag-4": "Named after a section of the Internal Revenue Code, the Subchapter S corporation is designed for smaller companies that need liability protection but don't have multiple shareholders to deal with. In fact, the S-Corp is limited to no more than 100 shareholders. The IRS refers to the S-Corp as a \"pass-through\" entity in which all profits and losses pass through to the owners, who report this information on their personal tax returns. The S-Corp can be a good choice for new businesses, since they often lose money in the early years and you can offset those losses against personal income. Later, as the business becomes consistently profitable, it may make more sense to switch to C corporation status.", "tag-5": "The LLC, or limited liability company, is also a pass-through entity in which profits and losses flow to the individual investors, who are called members. Like the S-Corp, members of the LLC aren't personally liable for its debts or obligations. But unlike the S-Corp, there is no limit to the number of members.", "tag-6": "The LLC is also somewhat more flexible than the S-Corp in that profits of the business can be allocated differently among various members. The LLC is a relatively new structure, while the S-Corp can be somewhat complex, so you should consult an attorney with plenty of experience in this area before deciding which route to take.", "tag-7": "INVESTMENT PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-8": "The information provided is solely for informational purposes.
