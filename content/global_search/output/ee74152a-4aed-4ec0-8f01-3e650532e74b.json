I witnessed firsthand the devastation and loss suffered by too many families when their loved ones are taken from them in the line of duty. The New York Police and Fire Widows' and Children's Benefit Fund steps in and assists with the financial burdens felt by these families--critical support during a difficult time. The Fund actively supports more than 630 families in and around New York City, and has given more than $123 million to the surviving loved ones of service workers.
