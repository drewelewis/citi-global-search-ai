As a result, family offices are professionalizing at a faster rate than before and can experience certain unique growing pains as with any other nascent industry,\" he continues.", "tag-5": "Wealth-X estimates that there are approximately 15,000 families globally at or above $250 million in net worth and that these families control approximately $13 trillion in wealth, which represents approximately half of all the wealth controlled by ultra high net worth individuals globally. The Family Office Group at Citi Private Bank surmises that the majority of these families either currently has a family office or will move to such a structure in the near future.", "tag-6": "\"In our experience working with family offices, we can attest that while every family is different, the challenges facing all substantially wealthy families are broadly similar and therefore require similar solutions. The challenges that come with substantial wealth are predictable and, as a result, many of the solutions to those challenges can be identified in advance. This solution-driven approach is what we hope to encourage through this white paper,\" said Edward Marshall.", "tag-7": "The white paper covers a number of essential topics and headwinds likely to arise within a family office and offers insights on how to best mitigate. The paper identified those areas where family offices are indeed different and warrant unique, family-specific approaches in the governance of the family office. The summary point being that understanding these areas and managing for and around the preferences and proclivities of the principals and their family members is how family office executives can truly distinguish themselves and help the family be successful.
