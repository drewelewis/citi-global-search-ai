We produced growth in both loans and deposits in Citicorp, reduced assets in Citi Holdings, continued to invest in our core businesses and improved our financial strength. Although the near-term macroeconomic outlook is uneven, Citi is consistently profitable, and we remain focused on producing responsible growth by serving our clients.\"", "tag-5": "John Gerspach, Citi's Chief Financial Officer, said: \"We expect to begin returning capital to shareholders next year and end that year with an 8%-9% Tier 1 Common Capital Ratio under Basel III. During the first half of 2011, we added an estimated $9 billion in Basel III regulatory capital through the 'multiplier effect' created by the combined impact of earnings and the utilization of our deferred tax assets. In addition, at the end of 2012, we currently expect Citigroup's risk-weighted assets under Basel III to be in the range of 135% of what they would be under Basel I and, more importantly, Citicorp's risk-weighted assets to be approximately 120% of what they would be under Basel I.\"", "tag-6": "Citicorp revenues were essentially flat from the prior year period, while the overall decline in Citigroup revenues from the prior year largely reflected lower results in Citi Holdings and Corporate/Other.", "tag-7": "Read the full press release with tables. View the Financial Supplement (PDF) View Financial Supplement (Excel)", "tag-8": "Citicorp revenues of $16.3 billion in the second quarter 2011 decreased less than 1% from the prior year period. Revenue growth in Citicorp's international Regional Consumer Banking (RCB) businesses and in Transaction Services during the quarter was offset by declines in Securities and Banking and North America RCB.", "tag-9": "Citi Holdings revenues declined 18% from the prior year period to $4.0 billion. The decline in Citi Holdings revenues was principally due to the ongoing declines in assets, which fell 34% from the prior year period to $308 billion. Since reaching its peak in the first quarter of 2008, Citi Holdings assets are now over half-a-trillion dollars lower.", "tag-10": "Corporate/Other revenues fell $400 million from the prior year period to $263 million. The decline in Corporate/Other revenues largely reflects lower revenues from investment yields and hedging activities.", "tag-11": "International RCB revenues in Asia, Latin America and EMEA increased 12% year-over-year in aggregate to $4.8 billion, reflecting growth in virtually all significant consumer banking drivers.", "tag-12": "North America RCB revenues declined 9% from the prior year period to $3.4 billion, principally caused by lower average card balances and the impact of the Credit Card Accountability Responsibility and Disclosure (CARD) Act.", "tag-13": "Transaction Services revenues grew 6% from the prior year period to $2.7 billion, as a result of strength across cash, trade and securities services products, particularly in the emerging markets.", "tag-14": "Securities and Banking revenues fell 8% year-over-year to $5.5 billion reflecting the ongoing challenging macro environment that led to difficult trading conditions in the second quarter and slightly lower customer activity levels, particularly in Fixed Income Markets.", "tag-15": "Citigroup's quarterly net income increased 24%, compared to the second quarter 2010, to $3.3 billion as a significant improvement in the cost of credit was partially offset by higher operating costs. Total cost of credit in the second quarter fell 49% to $3.4 billion. The improvement in credit costs was driven by a 35% decline in net credit losses to $5.1 billion and a $2.0 billion release of credit reserves, reflecting a lower level of inherent losses remaining in the portfolio. Operating expenses grew 9% from the prior year period to $12.9 billion, reflecting the impact of foreign exchange translation, volume-related expenses in Citicorp, legal and related expenses and ongoing investment spending, which were partially offset by ongoing reengineering benefits and lower expenses in Citi Holdings.", "tag-16": "Citigroup's total allowance for loan losses was $34.4 billion at quarter end, or 5.4% of total loans. The $2.0 billion net release of credit reserves was 37% higher than the prior year period as credit quality continued to improve during the second quarter. More than half of the net credit reserve release was attributable to Citi Holdings. Consumer loans that were 90+ days delinquent, excluding the Special Asset Pool (SAP), fell 46% versus the prior year period to $9.9 billion, or 2.3% of consumer loans, while corporate non-accrual loans fell 56% to $4.8 billion and consumer non-accrual loans fell 39% to $8.4 billion.", "tag-17": "Citigroup's capital levels and book value continued to increase in the quarter. Book value per share was $60.34 and tangible book value per share was $48.75, 13% and 16% increases, respectively, versus the prior year period. Citigroup's Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 13.6% and its Tier 1 Common Ratio was 11.6%, an increase of 161 bps and 189 bps, respectively, from the second quarter 2010.", "tag-18": "Citicorp Citicorp revenues decreased less than 1% from the prior year period to $16.3 billion. Strong revenue growth in the international RCB businesses and in Transaction Services was offset by revenue declines in North America RCB and Securities and Banking. The combined revenues of the international RCB (Asia, Latin America and EMEA) grew 12% from the prior year period, while Transaction Services revenues grew 6%. Offsetting that growth was a 9% decline in North America RCB revenues and an 8% decline in Securities and Banking revenues.", "tag-19": "Citicorp net income decreased 2% to $3.7 billion from the prior year period as declines in the cost of credit were offset by higher operating expenses. Increases in North America RCB were more than offset by net income declines in international RCB, Securities and Banking and Transaction Services.", "tag-20": "Citicorp cost of credit in the second quarter 2011 fell 46% to $1.3 billion from the prior year period. The decline was largely driven by an $812 million decline in net credit losses to $2.2 billion and a $249 million increase in the release of credit reserves to $914 million. The substantial majority of the reserve release (93%) was attributed to consumer loans, largely Citi-branded cards, as credit quality across the consumer portfolio continued to improve. Citicorp's loans 90+ days delinquent fell 26% from the prior year period to $2.8 billion, and the 90+ days delinquent ratio fell 34% to 1.15% of loans.", "tag-21": "Citicorp operating expenses increased 10% year-over-year to $10.1 billion. Excluding the UK bonus tax in the second quarter of 2010, expenses were up 14% year-over-year.", "tag-22": "Citicorp end of period loans grew 16% versus the prior year period, to $440 billion with most of the growth coming from the emerging markets. Consumer loans grew 11% to $244 billion and corporate loans grew 22% to $197 billion versus the prior year period.", "tag-23": "Regional Consumer Banking RCB revenues of $8.2 billion grew 2% year over year. Revenue growth of 12% in the international RCB was significantly offset by a 9% decline in North America RCB. Conversely, net income in international RCB declined 15% from the prior year period to $922 million, while North America RCB net income increased $632 million to $684 million, largely as a result of lower credit reserve releases internationally and higher releases in North America.", "tag-24": "North America RCB revenues declined 9% to $3.4 billion versus the prior year period. The decline was principally driven by the impact of the CARD Act and a 5% decline in average cards receivables to $72 billion. However, North America retail banking average loans grew 9% to $34 billion.", "tag-25": "North America RCB net income was $684 million, up from $52 million in the prior year period, driven by the release of credit reserves that was partially offset by higher operating expenses, which grew 17% year-over-year to $1.8 billion mostly due to investment spending in marketing and technology.", "tag-26": "North America RCB credit quality continued to improve as net credit losses fell 39% to $1.3 billion as compared to the prior year period, as there was broad improvement in delinquencies. The improving credit quality led to a credit reserve release of $757 million, compared to $9 million in the second quarter 2010. The second quarter 2011 reserve release was for Citi-branded cards.", "tag-27": "International RCB revenues grew across all regions versus the prior year period with EMEA revenues growing 4%, Latin America 15% and Asia 10%. Latin America and Asia each saw double digit growth year-over-year in average loans, average deposits, and purchase sales.", "tag-28": "International RCB net income, however, fell 15% from the prior year period to $922 million as credit reserve releases fell 78%, or $313 million, to $90 million, and operating expenses increased 19% to $3.0 billion due to ongoing investments in the franchise, the impact of foreign exchange translation and higher business volumes, partially offset by productivity gains.", "tag-29": "International RCB credit quality saw a decline in the reserve releases year-over-year as credit quality in our international RCB increasingly normalized as the underlying loan portfolios continued to grow.", "tag-30": "Securities and Banking Securities and Banking revenues fell 8% from the prior year period to $5.5 billion. Excluding CVA in the quarter of $147 million2, revenues were down 7% mainly due to lower results in Fixed Income Markets.", "tag-31": "Fixed Income revenues fell 18% from the prior year period to $3.0 billion. Macroeconomic concerns were exacerbated during the second quarter 2011 by a number of events that led to difficult trading conditions and slightly lower client activity in many products. The decline in Fixed Income Markets revenues year-over-year was largely in G10 rates and currencies. Revenues also declined in securitized products, while municipals and credit products produced revenue growth year-over-year.", "tag-32": "Equity Markets revenues grew 25% year-over-year to $812 million reflecting stronger results in derivatives and prime finance that offset weaker results in cash equities.", "tag-33": "Investment Banking revenues grew 61% year-over-year to $1.1 billion as activity levels across advisory and debt and equity underwriting increased from the second quarter 2010.", "tag-34": "Securities and Banking net income declined 29% from the second quarter 2010 to $1.2 billion, as expenses declined 1% but cost of credit increased to $59 million from a $176 million benefit in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of the UK bonus tax in the second quarter 2010, operating expenses grew 9%, reflecting the cost of continued investment spending and volume related costs offset by ongoing productivity savings.", "tag-35": "Transaction Services  Transaction Services revenues were $2.7 billion, up 6% from the prior year period, driven largely by volume in the international markets, where revenues grew 10%. This growth resulted from improved transaction activity and additions of corporate, public sector and financial clients.", "tag-36": "Transaction Services net income of $868 million fell 6% compared to the second quarter 2010, reflecting spread compression, an 18% increase in expenses to $1.4 billion from continued investment spending and an increase in loan loss reserves due to trade asset growth.", "tag-37": "Transaction Services average deposits and other customer liabilities balances grew 14% year-over-year to $365 billion with growth across all regions and assets under custody grew 19% to $13.5 trillion, reflecting increased customer inflows and higher marketing activity.", "tag-38": "Citi Holdings Citi Holdings revenues decreased 18% from the prior year period to $4.0 billion as assets declined 34% to $308 billion. Most of the revenue decline was in Local Consumer Lending (LCL) where revenues decreased 30% to $2.9 billion as end of period loans fell 31% to $198 billion. SAP revenues increased 77% year-over-year to $1.0 billion, reflecting positive revenue marks and the gains on selling $12.7 billion of assets that were transferred to trading from held-to-maturity at the end of the first quarter 2011. Brokerage and Asset Management revenues were $47 million, a decrease of 67% compared to the prior year period, due to a lower equity contribution from the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture.", "tag-39": "Citi Holdings net loss of $218 million decreased by $1.0 billion from the prior year period, despite a $908 million decline in revenues. Operating expenses decreased 9% to $2.2 billion and credit costs fell 51% to $2.1 billion. The decline in operating expenses reflected lower assets and volumes partially offset by higher legal and related expenses.", "tag-40": "Citi Holdings cost of credit decreased by 51% year-over-year to $2.1 billion, driven by a 40% reduction in net credit losses to $3.0 billion and a 26% increase in the credit reserve release to $1.1 billion. Credit improved in LCL with net credit losses declining 39% from the prior year period to $2.8 billion, combined with a 58% increase in the credit reserve release to $664 million. Improvement in net credit losses was reflected across most LCL portfolios, with retail partner cards and North America real estate lending being the leading contributors. Cost of credit in SAP also improved primarily due to a 53% reduction in net credit losses to $219 million.", "tag-41": "Citi Holdings allowance for credit losses was $19.6 billion at the end of the second quarter 2011, or 9.5% of loans. Delinquencies for LCL improved, as 90+ day delinquent loans decreased 51% to $7.1 billion, or 3.8% of loans.", "tag-42": "Corporate/Other Corporate/Other revenues decreased 60% to $263 million, compared to $663 million in the prior year period. The decline in revenues was mainly driven by hedging activities and lower investment yields, partially offset by the gain on the sale of Housing Development Finance Corporation Ltd. shares during the second quarter.", "tag-43": "Corporate/Other net income was a loss of $168 million, compared to net income of $193 million in the prior year period. The decline was due to the decline in revenues year-over-year, as well as higher legal and related expenses.", "tag-44": "Citi, the leading global financial services company, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
