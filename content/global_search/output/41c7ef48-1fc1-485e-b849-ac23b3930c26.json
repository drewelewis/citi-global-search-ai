We Listened.", "summary": "<strong>An Update for our Customers</strong>", "tag-1": "You Spoke. We Listened.", "tag-2": "An Update for our Customers", "tag-3": "As we celebrate Citi's 200th anniversary this year, we know there is still work to do every day to earn your business and your trust. We want to share another update on the feedback you've provided and how we've responded, from creating better travel rewards to providing more options for your points and simplifying ways to manage your account.", "tag-4": "We know you like rewards that really deliver. We are pleased to announce the launch of the Citi\u00ae Hilton HHonors\u2122 Reserve Card which delivers a better travel experience than before. In your first year of card membership, you can earn up to three weekend night certificates that can be used at 3,800 Hilton Worldwide properties. When you consider rates at the Beverly Hilton and Conrad New York are often $200 - this is a value that really adds up. Plus, you get automatic HHonors Gold status, so while you save you can also enjoy complimentary in-room Wifi access, beverages and snacks, executive lounge access, and available room upgrades. If you're traveling overseas, this new card does not charge foreign purchase transaction fees and has chip-based technology so you can make purchases with ease anywhere in the world. Visit www.hiltonreserve.com to learn more.", "tag-5": "You told us you want more reward options for your ThankYou\u00ae Points. You can now use your points to purchase tickets to your favorite concerts on LiveNation.com. Through Citi's relationship with Live Nation and the Citi\u00ae Private Pass\u00ae program (www.citiprivatepass.com), you can already enjoy exclusive ticket presales, preferred seating, VIP experiences and other special access. Now you can use your points to buy tickets to take you behind the scenes at Live Nation venues. It's easy--all you have to do is link your ThankYou\u00ae Rewards account on LiveNation.com and select the option to use ThankYou\u00ae Points as a payment method (all points or points plus your Citi card) in the check-out process. Even better, you can use the ThankYou Point Sharing App on Facebook to pool points with your friends who are ThankYou Members and then go to LiveNation.com to redeem the points for a shared concert or experience.", "tag-6": "We keep working to improve the basics. Over the next few months, you will begin receiving a redesigned monthly statement that is easier to read and understand. Based on your input, we simplified the format to fit on a regular letter-size piece of paper so your statement is easier to file. Your payment information is highlighted right upfront where you can find it quickly, along with a summary of any rewards or benefits you have earned. For those of you who manage your account online, you now can see and track pending charges before they appear on your statement. Finally, we have an exciting way to help you understand all of the benefits that come with your credit card, such as car rental insurance, retail purchase protection and extended warranty. When you visit benefitbuilder.citi.com or click \"Your Card Benefits\" from your online account, you can see all of the benefits that come with your card and add more, if you choose.", "tag-7": "We'll keep sharing updates and ask that you keep sharing your suggestions so we can better meet your needs. We won't be satisfied until you are."}
