Such a holistic digital policy can enable countries to reap the full benefits of a digitized economy.\"", "tag-6": "The report explains that a holistic digital policy rests on four pillars, digital infrastructure, digital adoption, service innovation, and digital trust, driven by a clear vision and supported by robust regulations and governance.", "tag-7": "It advises that as a first step, governments must establish a digital vision that aligns with their larger goals, such as promoting growth, improving service delivery, and increasing public involvement, among others.", "tag-8": "This year, results showed that countries that have augmented a holistic digital policy with targeted investments have performed particularly well. This was particularly evident in countries such as Malaysia, the United Arab Emirates, Estonia, and Uruguay, which have all outperformed their peers.", "tag-9": "Ronit Ghose, global head of banking, fintech and digital assets commented: \"It is evident in our latest findings that policymakers that played an active role, beyond enacting policies, have made considerable progress in driving digital adoption compared to peers.
