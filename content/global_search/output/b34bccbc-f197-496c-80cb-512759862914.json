I am encouraged by your feedback on our improvements, yet also know that some of your experiences have been less than perfect. And there is more that we can do. I can assure you that we are committed to delivering the products and service that you desire and deserve.", "tag-1": "Citi Cards Answers Your Questions", "tag-2": "Thank you for sharing your comments and questions in response to my recent blog post. I am encouraged by your feedback on our improvements, yet also know that some of your experiences have been less than perfect. And there is more that we can do. I can assure you that we are committed to delivering the products and service that you desire and deserve.", "tag-3": "I really appreciate the positive feedback on the changes we've made to the design of your statements. And while we've made progress in our online experience - like the ability to see pending transactions - I also understand that some aspects could be better. Over the coming months, you can expect to see more improvements in terms of design and online functionality directly in response to your feedback.", "tag-4": "Making your life easier while traveling is also important to us and an area where you tell us we can continue to improve. We now offer four cards that not only have great travel benefits, but also include chip technology. In addition, these cards don't charge foreign transaction fees on purchases. Cards that offer these benefits include the Citi ThankYouSM Premier Card, the Citi ThankYouSM Prestige Card, the Citi\u00ae Hilton HHonors\u2122 Reserve Card and the Citi Executive SM / AAdvantage\u00ae World Elite\u2122 MasterCard\u00ae. Behind the scenes, we are investing in new technology that will allow us to continue to protect you from fraud by making it easier to verify unusual account activity, and at the same time, reduce unnecessary disruptions when you're making purchases.", "tag-5": "Another area of focus - and one we've heard continues to be important to you - is providing more value from our rewards programs. While we've done a lot - including expanding redemption options and adding new features like the ability to purchase concert tickets on Livenation.com or share points through the ThankYou app on Facebook - you can expect to see more options for using your ThankYou points over the coming months. And we will continue to focus on making sure all of our reward programs are as clear and value-added as they should be.", "tag-6": "Finally, a number of you raised questions or issues related to your personal account. A member of our Customer Service team has reached out to you via phone or email but if you still would like to talk to someone, please don't hesitate to contact us. You can call 1-800-950-5114 or tweet @AskCiti to let us know how we can address your concerns.", "tag-7": "Again, I want to thank you for sharing your thoughts and feedback. Please keep it coming and let us know how we can do better. Hearing from you where we have got it right ... or where you'd like to see more from us helps make sure we are focused on what really matters to you."}
