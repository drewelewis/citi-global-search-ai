We expect a slowdown in domestic demand as well as investments. GDP slowdown will add to moderate pressure on prices, inflation will remain moderate in case strong exchange devaluation is avoided. Ukraine remains vulnerable to capital outflow due to high external debt repayments which means the pressure on FX market will grow. However our baseline scenario we expect hryvnia weakening will be limited and the exchange rate will stay at about 8.2 in the end of this year or the beginning of 2012.\"", "tag-5": "The discussion covered a wide range of issues, such as the state budget deficit, the banking system potential amid a rebounding economic environment, the hryvnia exchange rate and inflation. Among key topics for discussion were also political risks in developed countries driving up market volatility in the coming months, emerging markets currencies devaluing sharply, commodities following suit on the back of global risk aversion and concerns regarding global growth. Speakers also expanded on how the current wave of the financial crisis compares to 2008 and if Ukraine is prepared better or worse.", "tag-6": "\"We, at Citi, have continually said that high-growth-potential markets are very important for us,\" said Steven Fisher, CEO for Citi Ukraine. \"And Ukraine is among the top-priority countries when it comes to expanding our business.
