Under the CLP Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff (FiT) Scheme, Citi will receive FiT payments for connecting the system to CLP's electricity grid. The hybrid system, which also uses sun's energy to heat up water for use in Citi Tower, will contribute to a cost saving of approximately 4% of the building's annual power consumption.", "tag-1": "Citi Completes Renewable Energy System Installation at Citi Tower", "tag-2": "HIGHLIGHTS", "tag-3": "Hong Kong \u2013 Citi has installed a hybrid electrical and thermal renewable energy system on the rooftop of Citi Tower in Kowloon East.
