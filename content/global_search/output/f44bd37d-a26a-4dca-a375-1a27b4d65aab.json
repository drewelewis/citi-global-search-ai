Citibank Taiwan also conducted the market's first RMB exchange corporate service for a Taiwanese technology giant.", "tag-3": "Citibank Taiwan led the market with its cross-border trade expertise by assisting a local electronic giant in remitting part of its RMB-denominated funds from its operations in China to Taiwan. The bank then converted the funds into U.S. dollars before further remitting it to the company's U.S. Dollar account in Taiwan. This enabled the client to effectively centralize fund management across Taiwan and improve its operating efficiency.", "tag-4": "Citibank Taiwan also successfully converted a well-known Taiwanese technology giant's RMB-denominated funds into U.S. dollars, making the client the first to enjoy such a convenience in the domestic market. On the same day, Citi established an RMB-swap mechanism with Bank of China's Taipei branch and completed its first interbank RMB- denominated loan transaction with a major bank to provide clients with the best support in foreign exchange operations and capital allocation.", "tag-5": "As the Chinese currency continues to strengthen and local companies expand their operations overseas, the RMB is becoming increasingly important in their global cash flow. Citibank Research shows that over 10 percent of China's cross border trade is already settled in RMB. Enhancing RMB liquidity, reducing the costs associated with funds movements and foreign exchange risks as well as optimizing the use of capital is now of paramount importance to corporate clients.", "tag-6": "Citibank Taiwan is now fully equipped to meet these clients' needs to effectively reduce costs associated with account management, and auditing and remittance while enhancing operational efficiency. With its extensive global reach and solid infrastructure, Citi is well poised to help clients manage capital integration freely, safely and rapidly.", "tag-7": "In addition to cross-border RMB trades, Citibank will continue to offer corporate clients a comprehensive suite of products to assist with import and export trade in RMB, Letter of Credit Guarantees and Electronic Banking trading. Citibank Taiwan will also help companies in need of loans raise funds in RMB through diversified channels to reduce capital costs. Until February 27, the bank will not charge corporate clients handling costs for outward and inward remittances of RMB-denominated funds through their RMB accounts.", "tag-8": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
