Citi is proud to once again sponsor this renowned tournament, which has become a summer sports staple in the DC-area for the past 45 years. And the 2013 Citi Open tournament promises to be the best yet.", "tag-3": "First and foremost, the Citi Open tennis tournament offers world renowned tennis as one of only 11 elite Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) World Tour 500-level events worldwide and the only one held in the United States. In addition, the Citi Open tournament features a Women's Tennis Association (WTA) International Tournament, which provides fans the opportunity to watch simultaneous competitions of men's, women's, and doubles' tennis throughout the event.", "tag-4": "The Citi Open tournament features plenty of off-the-court fun, including food and wine tastings, events celebrating military, veterans, first responders, and their families, a chef challenge, prizes, and more.", "tag-5": "But perhaps the most important feature of the Citi Open tournament is the owner and beneficiary - the Washington Tennis and Education Foundation (WTEF). Founded more than 50 years ago, the WTEF is an organization that helps to lift up low-income, underserved children in Washington, DC through tennis and academic enrichment. WTEF provides a safe environment to keep kids off the street and focused on educational goals, life skills and - of course - tennis.", "tag-6": "In November 2012, WTEF celebrated the opening of a new Tennis, Education and Community Center in D.C.'s Ward 7, the heart of the neighborhood where many of these children live and go to school. The amazing new facility includes classrooms, a computer lab, indoor and outdoor tennis courts, a community room, fitness center, and more - all of which offer increased opportunities for a dramatic change in the lives of underserved DC youth. With the new facility, WTEF is serving more students, increasing retention rates, and providing leadership and employment opportunities in the area. The center has extended its operating hours and also serves as a community center.", "tag-7": "The Citi Open tournament runs through August 4, and I encourage anyone who is able to attend and enjoy an exciting tennis tournament while supporting such a worthy cause as WTEF.
