The sponsorship exceeded our expectations in every way.", "tag-3": "Last week, we were honored to host 3 members of Team Citi --U.S. Olympians Christie Rampone, Sanya Richards-Ross and U.S. Paralympian Amanda McGrory - at the flagship headquarters branch in New York City to celebrate the success of the Every Step of the Way\u2120 program.", "tag-4": "We are so proud of the U.S. Team for winning the most golds and overall medals, and also of the 13 U.S. Olympic and Paralympic athletes on Team Citi who allowed us to do something unique with the 'Every Step of the Way' program.", "tag-5": "In April, Citi announced a $500,000 donation - in addition to our sponsorship -- to the U.S. Olympic Committee to benefit 12 Olympic sport programs across the country, each picked by a member of Team Citi. What made Every Step unique was that colleagues, customers and fans were able to direct the donation through their activity on Facebook and Twitter. The Programs, like Win with Integrity, Soccer for Success, Great Lakes Adaptive Sports Association and Make a Splash - all have one thing in common - they are about supporting the next generation of athletes on their journey from ambition to achievement.", "tag-6": "In addition to hosting the athletes, we also welcomed one of New York's great sportscasters Bruce Beck from WNBC, to chat with Team Citi. At the event, each athlete presented their 'Signature Step' to a representative from the Sport Program that inspired them. The one-of-a-kind imprints represent each athlete's step on the journey from ambition to achievement and the lasting impact of the Every Step of the Way program. Each Sport Program will receive funding ranging from approximately $25,000 to $45,000 based on the specific need identified by Team Citi Athletes for the Every Step of the Way program.", "tag-7": "We want to congratulate Team Citi for their terrific performance in London for Team USA -- they won a combined 11 Olympic and Paralympic medals (6 gold!) -- and thank them for helping us leave a lasting impact in communities across the country. It was a privilege to support Team USA as they competed for gold.", "tag-8": "For a complete list of the athletes and their sports programs, click here."}
