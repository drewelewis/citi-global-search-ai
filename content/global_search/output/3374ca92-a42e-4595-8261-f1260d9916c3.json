She supports the USA Hockey Foundation's Try Hockey For Free Days, a program that every year offers thousands of kids across the country the opportunity to experience the excitement of playing hockey for the very first time. Learn what drives her success. <br><strong><br>Q: You originally were a figure skater. Why did you switch to hockey? </strong> <br><br>A: When I was 8 years old, I was signed up for figure skating along with my sister while my brother was signed up for hockey. Those were the stereotypical divides at the time. During my first two months in figure skates my eyes kept wandering towards the side where the boys were playing hockey, and they just seemed to be having a lot of fun. I asked my parents if I could play hockey, and it's been amazing ever since. <br><strong><br>Q: What was it like playing hockey with the boys as the only girl? </strong> <br><br>A: If I was teased it was normally by players on the other team. Occasionally I'd be lined up at a face off, and with the last name Chu, I would hear someone next to me go 'Achoo' and kind of sneeze next to me, trying to make fun of my name. Although there were girls teams available, I continued playing on the boys hockey team until I was 17 years old. At that point boys got taller, and a lot heavier than me, and they tended to want to go after the girl a little bit more. I think that was the time when I had the opportunity to switch to girl's hockey. <br><strong><br>Q: Do you have a personal mantra? </strong> <br><br>A: My personal mantra is to 'live the life I love' and embrace it with enthusiasm. I believe that when I approach everything in my life with enthusiasm -- whether it is about mundane things, or something I am not really sure I will enjoy -- I find that I get more out of these situations when I have the right attitude. <br><strong><br>Q: To what do you attribute your incredible career? </strong> <br><br>A: I cannot say that I am the most skilled or the fastest player. I believe that I have been able to be on the national team since the year 2000 because I have been a very consistent player. I'm willing to work hard every day and prepare in order to execute when time comes. I take a lot of pride in the fact that every day, every game, my teammates and my coaches know what they are going to get from me. <br><strong><br>Q: You're looked at as a huge role model and you support the USA Hockey Foundation. How has this mission impacted kids' lives? </strong> <br><br>A: I'm very fortunate to be working with the USA Hockey Foundation and their Try Hockey For Free Days. It is a great initiative because hockey in general isn't the most accessible sport to everyone--getting equipment and ice time can be difficult. The program allows kids to come to a local rink, borrow equipment and try hockey for free. I want women's hockey to continue growing, and I think the Try Hockey For Free Days program does exactly that. <br><br><a href=\"https://everystep.citi.com/#julie\">Learn more</a> about how you can support Julie and the USA Hockey Foundations' Try Hockey for Free Days program.", "tag-1": "Q&A with Citi Team Member Julie Chu: Driven and Enthusiastic", "tag-2": "Join us as we profile nine Team Citi athletes on the Citi Blog as part of our Every Step of the Way program.
