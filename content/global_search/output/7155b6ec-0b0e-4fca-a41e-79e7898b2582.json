Better new orders in the US ISM index and slightly stronger-than-expected GDP, as well as some modest job growth and improved jobless claims, all have contributed to a sense of relief that America is not double dipping. We had stressed for a good while that the current US credit environment was far better than that seen in 2007-08.", "tag-4": "Fortunately, when the credit backdrop does not implode -- as it did in 2008 -- industrial activity can expand. With a close (nine-month lagged) relationship between credit conditions, earnings and industrial production, the lack of major borrowing cost increases is very supportive for the S&P 500 EPS trend, in our view. While there are fears that margins have to contract meaningfully, given their high levels, history suggests to us that a US recession would be needed to crush profitability.", "tag-5": "NOTE: This post is adapted from Citi North America Equity Strategy's \"The November 2011 Chart of the Month,\" published on November 9, 2011."}
