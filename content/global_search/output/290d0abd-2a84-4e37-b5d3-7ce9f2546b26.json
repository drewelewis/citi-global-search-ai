These dollars not only benefit New York families, but also our local economy. I encourage New Yorkers to go get every dollar of their refund by filing for free online, at one of the City's 69 different free tax sites across the five boroughs, or with the City's coupon at H&R Block locations for only $29 throughout the entire tax season; and I also encourage New Yorkers to save some of their refund to qualify for a 50 percent match through the SaveUSA program.
