I spent the early 2000s as an infantry officer in the U.S. Army. Part of that time included a year in Afghanistan split between Kandahar and Zabul provinces where I served as a liaison to the United Nations and later with my infantry unit. At the end of my rotation, I faced one of the toughest decisions: what's next?", "tag-1": "How the Military Prepared Me for the Private Sector", "tag-2": "I am one of America's 21.2 million veterans.

I wanted to continue to contribute, to be part of a team, and help an organization succeed. I knew I could produce if given the opportunity, but I was not sure how my skills and experiences translated into the private sector.", "tag-4": "Luckily for me, I joined a company that actively pursues veterans, and offers programs designed to help them start a career and assimilate into the workforce. Citi's commitment to veterans did more than offer me the chance to contribute \u2013 it was a clear signal the company valued what I had to offer and they were willing to invest in me.", "tag-5": "While more employers may be hiring veterans, many do not recognize the unique attributes veterans possess to strengthen their organization. In a 2014 Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America survey of more than 2,000 of its members, one in five, reported being unable to find a job that matched their skill level, suggesting that underemployment remains a problem for many vets.", "tag-6": "As veterans, our experience may have been earned in the military, but it is directly applicable in the private sector. More than a decade after leaving the Army, I have completed the transition from the military to the private sector. I am proud to serve as the President of Citi's campus in Jacksonville, FL, and have the privilege of working with more than 200 other veterans every day. Through the experiences as a manager in the civilian workforce as well as my own time in the military, I have personally witnessed just how capable our military service members are \u2013 in uniform and in the workforce.", "tag-7": "The veterans I work with daily have constructed airfields in combat zones, been responsible for inspecting offshore oil rigs in the Gulf of Mexico, and served as intelligence officers supporting Special Operations to name only a few. We have engineers, technologists, operations managers, and a number of others working throughout our organization. They are ready and willing to handle pressure and bring a \"failure is not an option\" mindset. They bring an attitude forged in a deep sense of responsibility to those directly impacted by their ability to successfully complete a mission, including safeguarding the safety of those around them.", "tag-8": "A common misperception is that the military's structure squashes creativity. In reality, military personnel are forced to adapt to new situations and think outside of the box. They know that an ability to make sound decisions in dynamic situations with limited time and information can mean the difference between success and failure. And, in some cases between life and death. The experiences these individuals faced are not easily matched at such a young age.", "tag-9": "As employers, we need to commit to recruiting and training these highly capable men and women, provide them with opportunities to grow and pathways to succeed. By giving back to those who served our country, we're making smart investments in them and our companies.", "tag-10": "Visit CitiSalutes.com to learn more about Citi's Veterans Initiatives."}
