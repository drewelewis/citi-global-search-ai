The bank has been collaborating in this area with select partners from the ranks of non-profit organizations for a number of years. Through its long-term strategic support for financial capability, the Citi Foundation seeks to help to guide the Czech public towards financial responsibility and improve the public's financial capability, open up a debate among experts on these issues and help put in place a clear-cut, fully sufficient and carefully planned educational scheme at the national level.", "tag-5": "This year, Citibank and Masaryk University launched a pilot project called the Financial Capability Program, which follows up on the conclusions drawn from an in-depth survey conducted last year and those of the conference entitled 'How to properly financially educate adults.' The aim of the project is to develop a sustainable framework for the systematic financial education of adults, with a potentially nationwide reach.

Its purpose is to provide young students with the required financial knowledge and skills that will motivate them to continue their education which they will be able to use in their future careers as well as in their everyday lives. 'JA Banks in Action' is a computer simulation in which student teams (each representing a fictitious financial institution) compete with each other on the financial market. Through this program, students have an opportunity to gain insight into the inner workings of banks; for example, they can try out decision-making on interest rates and learn about certain specifics of the banking market.", "tag-8": "Citibank also helps to empower Czech non-governmental non-profit organizations' social business through its support for the 'Accelerator' program organized by the Via Foundation.", "tag-9": "Citibank Employee Charity Fund The projects of Czech non-profit organizations are usually geared towards supporting variously disadvantaged groups of the population, and Citibank assists them, on a one-off or short-term basis, with financial gifts from its Citibank Employee Charity Fund. The Fund is comprised of employee contributions, with a matching contribution provided by the bank, and is allocated twice a year to those non-profit organizations operating in the Czech Republic that satisfy certain formal requirements and submit an official grant application.
