The heat generated is used for cooking, sterilizing and industrial purposes. The cooker has considerably improved the quality of life of slum dwellers by minimizing waste, reducing emissions from cooking, providing a cheaper alternative to wood fuel and creating youth employment. Kenyan architects Planning Systems Service created the concept, which is now managed by the Community Cooker Foundation, a not-for-profit organization. The cooker currently has one prototype in operation in one of Nairobi's largest slums but is already being replicated in other areas in Kenya and in Mombassa. The Foundation has received many enquiries from other countries which are keen to replicate this simple and effective concept.", "tag-9": "College Possible", "tag-10": "Creating a vital support network, College Possible helps ensure that low-income students achieve a post secondary degree and break the cycle of multi generational poverty, enabling them to have a positive impact on the success of their urban communities. College Possible uses the national service model of AmeriCorps to provide five key services to low-income students who have the potential to go to college, but will struggle to do so without help. It provides intensive ACT/SAT preparation, assists college application, gives financial aid consulting, provides guidance in the transition to college and offers support towards completion of their college degree.", "tag-11": "GlaxoSmithKline New Citizen", "tag-12": "The GSK New Citizen Health Care Project is an innovative 100-square meter urban center designed to integrate migrant populations into city life through the delivery of community health promotion, healthcare education and health services.

The concept is based on three core principles; developing a system that is easy to use, available everywhere and affordable. Velib' enables individuals to hire a self-service bicycle for an indefinite time and leave it in the station of their choice at the end of their journey. The scale, quality and scope of Velib' made it a showcase for bicycle hire schemes and has been replicated worldwide.", "tag-15": "For more details on the FT/Citi Ingenuity Awards, please visit www.ft.com/ingenuity."}
