In the quarter, both our Global Consumer Bank and Institutional Clients Group had solid year-over-year revenue increases in nearly every business line and geography. We also continued to grow core loans and deposits while reducing non-core assets to just 3% of our balance sheet.", "tag-6": "\"We remain intensely focused on shareholder returns. The acquisition of the Costco portfolio and the recently announced sales of our retail operations in Argentina and Brazil are the latest examples of how we are shifting resources to the areas we believe will generate the best returns for our shareholders.", "tag-7": "\"Our Common Equity Tier 1 ratio increased to 12.6% and we remain committed to consistently increasing the amount of capital we return to our shareholders in order to improve overall returns. In the past two years, we have lowered the amount of outstanding common shares by 180 million or 6%. Our Tangible Book Value per share increased to $64.71 in the quarter, an 8% increase from one year ago, reflecting both the impact of these stock repurchases and our efforts to deliver quality and consistent earnings,\" Mr. Corbat concluded.", "tag-8": "In the discussion throughout the remainder of this press release, Citigroup's results of operations in the prior year period are presented excluding CVA/DVA, as applicable, for consistency with the current period's presentation (see note 4 to this release).

Total non-accrual assets of $6.1 billion fell 8% from the prior year period. Consumer non-accrual loans declined 26% to $3.6 billion. Corporate non-accrual loans of $2.4 billion increased $837 million from the prior year period, mostly related to energy-related loans in the Institutional Clients Group (ICG), but decreased 2% from the prior quarter.", "tag-15": "Citigroup's loans were $638 billion as of quarter end, up 2% from the prior year period, and up 3% in constant dollars. In constant dollars, 7% growth in Citicorp loans was somewhat offset by continued declines in Citi Holdings, driven primarily by continued reductions in the North America mortgage portfolio.", "tag-16": "Citigroup's deposits were $940 billion as of quarter end, up 4% both on a reported basis and in constant dollars. In constant dollars, Citicorp deposits increased 5%, driven by a 4% increase in ICG deposits and a 5% increase in Global Consumer Banking (GCB) deposits. In constant dollars, Citi Holdings deposits declined 37%, driven by divestiture activity.", "tag-17": "Citigroup's book value per share was $74.51 and tangible book value per share was $64.71, each as of quarter end, both representing 8% increases.

The net loan loss reserve build was $298 million in the current quarter, compared to $174 million in the prior year period, while net credit losses were largely unchanged versus the prior year. Citicorp's consumer loans 90+ days delinquent increased 9% to $2.2 billion, largely driven by portfolio growth and normal portfolio seasoning, and the 90+ days delinquency ratio increased slightly to 0.75% of loans from 0.74% in the prior year period.", "tag-23": "Citicorp end of period loans of $599 billion increased 6%.

Citi-branded cards revenues of $2.2 billion increased 15%, reflecting the addition of the Costco portfolio as well as modest organic growth driven by higher volumes. Citi retail services revenues of $1.6 billion increased 1%, as underlying portfolio growth was largely offset by the impact of previously-disclosed partnership program renewals as well as the absence of revenues from portfolio exits. Retail banking revenues increased 2% to $1.4 billion, on higher average loans and checking deposits.", "tag-27": "North America GCB net income was $811 million, down 25%, driven by an increase in cost of credit and higher operating expenses, partially offset by the higher revenues.

The net loan loss reserve build in the third quarter 2016 was $408 million, compared to a net loan loss reserve release of $61 million in the prior year period, mostly reflecting a reserve build in cards driven by the impact of the acquisition of the Costco portfolio, volume growth and normal seasoning of the portfolios, as well as the estimated impact of newly proposed regulatory guidelines on third party collections. Net credit losses of $929 million increased 6%, driven by volume growth.", "tag-29": "International GCB revenues decreased 7% to $3.0 billion and decreased 2% in constant dollars. On this basis, revenues in Latin America GCB of $1.3 billion decreased 7%, reflecting the absence of a previously-disclosed $160 million gain ($180 million as reported) related to the sale of Citi's merchant acquiring business in Mexico in the third quarter 2015. Excluding this gain, revenues would have increased 5%, driven by growth in retail banking loans and deposits, partially offset by a decline in cards driven by the continued impact of higher payment rates. Revenues in Asia GCB of $1.8 billion increased 3%, driven by growth in wealth management and cards revenues, partially offset by continued repositioning away from lower-return mortgage loans in the retail lending portfolio.", "tag-30": "International GCB net income decreased 22% to $474 million. In constant dollars, net income decreased 15%, driven by the lower revenue and higher credit costs. Operating expenses decreased 4% on a reported basis and were approximately unchanged versus the prior year period in constant dollars as ongoing efficiency savings offset investment spending and slightly higher legal and related and repositioning costs. Credit costs increased 3% on a reported basis and 13% in constant dollars. On such basis, the net loan loss reserve build was $25 million, compared to a net loan loss reserve release of $47 million in the prior year period, net credit losses decreased 5% and the net credit loss rate was 1.53% of average loans, improved from 1.59% in the prior year period.", "tag-31": "Institutional Clients Group", "tag-32": "Banking revenues of $4.1 billion (including the impact of gain / (loss) on loan hedges) decreased 6%.

In constant dollars, TTS revenues grew 8% reflecting continued growth in transaction volumes. Investment Banking revenues of $1.1 billion increased 15%, primarily reflecting increased industry-wide debt underwriting activity during the current quarter. Advisory revenues were unchanged at $239 million and equity underwriting fell 16% to $146 million, while debt underwriting revenues increased 32% to $701 million. Private Bank revenues of $746 million increased 4%, driven by loan growth, improved spreads and higher managed investment revenues. Corporate Lending revenues of $450 million increased 4% (excluding gain / (loss) on loan hedges), mostly reflecting higher average loans.", "tag-33": "Markets and Securities Services revenues of $4.5 billion increased 11%. Fixed Income Markets revenues of $3.5 billion increased 35%, driven by improvement in both rates and currencies and spread products. Equity Markets revenues of $663 million decreased 34%. The third quarter 2015 included the previously-disclosed reversal of a charge to revenues of approximately $140 million for valuation adjustments related to certain financing transactions. Excluding this adjustment, Equity Markets revenues decreased 23% driven by lower market activity as well as the comparison to strong performance in Asia in the prior year. Securities Services revenues of $536 million increased 4% and increased 6% in constant dollars, as increased client activity, higher deposit volumes and improved spreads more than offset the absence of revenues from divested businesses.", "tag-34": "ICG net income of $2.8 billion increased 20%, driven by the higher revenues, lower cost of credit and lower operating expenses. ICG operating expenses decreased 1% to $4.7 billion, driven by lower legal and related costs, efficiency savings and a benefit from foreign exchange translation. ICG cost of credit was negative $90 million, compared to $313 million in the prior year period. ICG cost of credit included net credit losses of $45 million ($37 million in the prior year period) and a net loan loss reserve release of $135 million (net loan loss reserve build of $276 million in the prior year period). The improvement in cost of credit largely reflected ratings upgrades, reductions in certain exposures and improved valuations.", "tag-35": "ICG average loans grew 5% to $306 billion while end of period deposits increased 4% to $617 billion.
