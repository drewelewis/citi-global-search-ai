In my experience, deals don't come together in this town until the eleventh hour.", "tag-1": "The Supercommittee's Ticking Clock", "tag-2": "In typical Washington fashion, the handwringing has begun over the Supercommittee's ability to reach a deal by November 23 that would cut the federal deficit by $1.2 trillion. In my experience, deals don't come together in this town until the eleventh hour.", "tag-3": "Indeed, few anticipated anything would begin to cement until now and the chatter around a potential deal has started. The Congressional Budget Office needs to begin scoring - putting a price tag on the proposal - by Monday. With the weekend still in front of us, the Supercommittee has both the time and ability to get something done.", "tag-4": "There is reason for cautious optimism. Revenue and entitlements have been the sticking points, but several Congressional rank-and-file members have begun to show willingness to compromise. Some Republicans have conceded the need for revenue measures, while Democrats have begun to embrace the idea of spending cuts, possibly including small, relatively noncontroversial changes to entitlements.", "tag-5": "The involvement of the two leaders - House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid (D-NV) - is a welcome move. Both leaders have the political will to reach a deal, and the political clout to bring along their parties when the time comes for a vote.", "tag-6": "There are several compelling reasons why a deal may still be struck. First, failure to reach accord could result in \"sequestration;\" across the board budget cuts that will most heavily impact the defense industry. There are a number of defense hawks and Members who have defense interests that could motivate action.", "tag-7": "Second, Congress has certainly taken note of what has happened with the debt crisis in Europe, specifically Greece and Italy, and many believe we must take bold action now to prevent a similar, future crisis here.", "tag-8": "Finally, a significant number of Members, particularly among the large Freshman Republican class, were elected by running on a platform of lowering the deficit, attaining a balanced federal budget, and helping to foster economic growth. They feel as though they have made a commitment to their constituents and the American people overall to take massive steps to cut the deficit, a message their voters have not forgotten."}
