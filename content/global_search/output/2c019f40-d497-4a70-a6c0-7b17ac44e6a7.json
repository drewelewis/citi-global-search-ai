By 2030, the world's urban population is projected to increase to just under 5 billion, or roughly 60% of the global total. And as the world moves into an era of unprecedented urbanization, conversations like those that occurred at this year's Symposium become even more critical because decisions leaders make today will impact more than half of the world's future population over the coming decades.", "tag-5": "Participating young leaders were drawn from a diversity of backgrounds, experience and affiliations, including entrepreneurs, nonprofit organization founders and senior civil servants already managing major government agencies. The passion, drive and conviction that these young leaders displayed in pursuit of the broad goal of \"a better city for a better tomorrow\" were inspiring. As a team, we were honored to be part of this vibrant conversation and to be able to contribute our own thoughts, insights and expertise to such an important platform for discussing and debating issues and challenges of significant social concern. As employees of a global company whose mission is to enable economic growth and progress around the world with a focus on urban areas, we couldn't think of a better place to learn and exchange ideas with the future leaders of the world's cities than right here in Singapore at the World Cities Summit."}
