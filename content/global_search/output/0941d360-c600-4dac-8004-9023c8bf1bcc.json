Youth unemployment is an open wound for our society: apart from the negative financial and psychological effects at the individual level, it undermines future economic growth and social cohesion. It is assumed that investing in young people and the development of certain conditions in order to 'unleash' their talents, is the most direct and guaranteed path to financial development. It is also proven that our young people have great talents that can be appreciated in the labor market, even in today's crisis.\"", "tag-8": "Grant Carson added: \"Young people are one of the leading forces behind development and innovation. Their curiosity and passion to make the world better, coupled to their comfort with change can make the difference. As times change, new strategies are required. What worked for one generation is not necessarily good enough for the next. It's our moral duty to help young people discern the changing needs of the world around them and redefine their vision and strategy.\"", "tag-9": "Policy Recommendations The policy recommendations that came to light through the survey and open discussion with stakeholders, are addressed to (a) young people, (b) the state, (c) the collective bodies, (d) companies and employers, (e) universities and (f) to private job recruitment agencies.", "tag-10": "Proposals for young people:", "tag-11": "Proposals for the State include:", "tag-12": "How companies and employers can contribute", "tag-13": "The role of Universities \u2013 Higher Education Institutions", "tag-14": "The contribution of private career offices", "tag-15": "The proposed role of Collective Bodies", "tag-16": "Survey identity and results The survey conducted was based on qualitative and quantitative methodology, and included focus groups and interviews, as well as three field surveys, two addressing to young people 18-29 years old, in which 1.387 persons participated, and one involving Human Resource Management executives with 178 company representatives.", "tag-17": "The project's administrative supervision was under the responsibility of Mr. Aristotelis Alexopoulos, Senior Project Manager of ALBA's Applied Research & Innovation department.", "tag-18": "The basic survey results are the following:", "tag-19": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
