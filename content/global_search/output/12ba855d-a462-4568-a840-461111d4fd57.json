It's easy enough to find out.", "tag-3": "Go to www.socialsecurity.gov. Look for a link on the site's home page that is labeled \"Estimate your retirement benefits.\" Click on that link and you'll be asked a few basic questions: your name, Social Security number, date of birth, the state where you were born, your mother's maiden name and last year's total wages and net self-employment income. In a few seconds, you'll have your answer.", "tag-4": "The site will typically tell you how much you will receive if you claim benefits at the earliest possible age of 62, at your \"full retirement age\" of 66 or 67 (it varies depending on the year you were born) and at age 70. By waiting until age 70, you would get the largest possible monthly benefit.", "tag-5": "The site also allows you to create different scenarios. Suppose you think you might retire at age 68 and you expect to earn less in future years. Using these assumptions, the site will give you an estimate of what your benefit might be.", "tag-6": "Keep in mind that the benefits you see now are likely to change by the time you claim Social Security. For instance, unless you create a different scenario, the Social Security Administration assumes you will continue earning at last year's rate. If you make more money in the future, your benefits may increase. Also, the benefits shown are in today's dollars and, by the time you claim Social Security, they will likely be higher because of inflation. In addition, estimated benefits are based on current law-- without any cutbacks that some politicians are advocating.", "tag-7": "INVESTMENTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022 NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-8": "The information provided is solely for informational purposes.
