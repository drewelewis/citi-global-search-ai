Result: More parents are paying college bills when they're in their 60s.", "tag-3": "That means parents may face the challenge of paying for college even as they look to retire. But it also opens up an intriguing way to sock away dollars for college costs: If you'll be in your 60s when your children graduate and you're confident you have enough set aside for retirement, you might save for college by funding traditional Individual Retirement Accounts, Roth IRAs, 403(b) plans and 401(k) plans.", "tag-4": "These accounts aren't included among the assets used to determine eligibility for federal-financial aid, and many colleges also ignore these accounts when doling out their own aid. Yes, withdrawals from retirement accounts would boost your adjusted gross income, thereby increasing your tax bill. The increase in income could also potentially jeopardize financial aid for the following year. But you could sidestep this problem by taking out loans to pay college costs and then repaying the loans with IRA withdrawals after your kids graduate.", "tag-5": "What if your children get heaps of financial aid or go to less expensive colleges--and you don't have to pay nearly as much as you expected? You can hang onto the dollars you stashed in your IRA and 401(k), and use them for your own retirement or bequeath them to the kids.", "tag-6": "Investment Products: NOT FDIC INSURED .
