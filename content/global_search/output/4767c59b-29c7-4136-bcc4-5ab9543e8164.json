You still have several months to make adjustments for 2011 and perhaps avoid a significant tax penalty.", "tag-3": "To figure out where you stand, check how much you had last year in earnings, investment income, realized capital gains and other income--and think about how your total 2011 income might compare. If your estimated income for this year is lower than 2010, you may be in good shape and perhaps can even think about having less taxes withheld from your paycheck and paying less in estimated taxes.", "tag-4": "On the other hand, if your income is higher, you may want to send along more in estimated taxes to both the federal and your state government or arrange to have more taxes withheld from your paycheck. The deadline for third-quarter estimated tax payments is Sept. 15 and the deadline for the fourth quarter is Jan. 17, 2012.", "tag-5": "There are a number of reasons your income may be significantly higher than last year. For example, if you converted your Individual Retirement Account to a Roth IRA, that might have triggered a significant tax bill. Alternatively, perhaps you or your spouse has seen a jump in self-employment income or you have cashed in investment gains after a few years of rising markets.", "tag-6": "Whatever the reason, try to make sure your federal tax payments during the year cover at least 90% of 2011's tax bill or equal 100% of the tax you paid in 2010. Otherwise, you could face penalties and interest. But if you expect your total tax underpayment for this year to be less than $1,000, you probably won't face a penalty.", "tag-7": "INVESTMENT PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022 NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-8": "The information provided is solely for informational purposes.
