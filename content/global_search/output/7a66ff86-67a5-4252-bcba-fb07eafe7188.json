To answer this question, we'll often look at our portfolio, focusing on the mix of stocks and conservative investments.", "tag-3": "But just because some investors have a heftier allocation to stocks doesn't mean they're taking more risk than other folks with less aggressive investment mixes.

Her government job will pay her a pension when she quits the work force. He isn't nearly so lucky. The bottom line: While her portfolio is more aggressive, her overall finances appear to be more conservative--and maybe she can afford to take a little more risk with her investments.", "tag-9": "INVESTMENT PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-10": "The information provided is solely for informational purposes.
