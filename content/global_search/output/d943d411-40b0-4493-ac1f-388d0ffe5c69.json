Despite the slowdown in Western Europe and North America and \u2013 as a result \u2013 somewhat subdued consumer optimism, we believe December will remain the culmination of annual spend in Russia.\"", "tag-5": "For the first time ever, online spending has also been considered. The study found that during the year, volume of online spending increased faster than other expenditures: online payments grew 7.6 percent faster than other spending. Despite this, according to the forecast, the volume of purchases through online stores is expected to increase 17 percent in December, as opposed to 28 percent increase in credit card spending. Analysts believe that this can be explained by consumers' propensity to shop brick-and-mortar stores for New Year's and Christmas gifts in order to reduce the risk of late delivery of goods purchased online. In addition, starting mid-December, many online stores no longer accept orders for delivery by the New Year. In 2011, an average online purchase (including the December forecast) will reach approximately RUB3,500 while overall share of payments in 2011 is expected to be near 20 percent.", "tag-6": "For the second year in a row, the study considered geographical aspect: once again, the expectation is that Muscovites will have a relatively quiet New Year shopping season (a 21 percent December spike over the monthly average is anticipated) while residents of St. Petersburg and regional cities of Russia2 will experience the strongest shopping impact (with 38 percent and 30 percent increase, respectively). Nevertheless, Moscow residents will spend approximately RUB18,000 on average (RUB 2,000 more than last year), while residents of St. Petersburg and regional cities are expected to spend RUB16,000 and RUB11,000, respectively (RUB4,000 and RUB3,000 more, respectively, than in 2010).", "tag-7": "Clothing stores will remain in the top-10 spending categories (accounting for 11 percent of all expected purchases in December) as well as supermarkets and grocery stores (with the combined share of 9 percent), hotels (5 percent), fast food restaurants (5 percent), and electronics & appliances stores (5 percent).", "tag-8": "Traditionally, spirits and wine stores and toy stores will be the most popular categories (growth of 123 percent and 93 percent, respectively). Electronics & appliances category is expected to grow substantially: a 70-percent increase in spending compared to the monthly average. Spending in photo equipment and photo services and hardware stores will follow (61 percent and 58 percent, respectively). Total share of spending at music and book stores is expected to be 71 percent and 46 percent, respectively. The supermarkets and grocery stores category is expected to grow by 48 percent, and home appliances by 45 percent.", "tag-9": "Over the past three years, Russians have been preparing for the New Year travels in advance: the level of spending on New Year trips and, consequently, on airfares remains elevated throughout the autumn months peaking in October.

The forecast for December 2011 is based on data for 11 months of 2011 and took into consideration the statistic trends over the past three years.
