The network will bring together municipal leaders from cities across the U.S. to understand how systemic racism impacts their cities and residents, and provides support to experiment, document and share lessons learned on how to address racial disparities and how to accelerate the adoption of best practices that close racial income and wealth gaps. The Network builds upon a previous effort, the City Accelerator, which engaged U.S. cities in testing innovations that that applied a racial equity lens to the delivery of municipal services and the design of inclusive public policies."}
