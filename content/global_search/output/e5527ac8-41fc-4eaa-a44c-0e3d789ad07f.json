Moreover, just 50 percent of those surveyed say they would move to California today if they did not already live in the state.", "tag-4": "The findings continue the trend of caution that Citibank's quarterly survey has identified over the last 18 months, as California residents remain wary about both the economy and their own personal financial situations, despite signs that the state is emerging from the recession.", "tag-5": "\"Until Californians see tangible signs of a recovery in their own lives and communities, a mood of caution will prevail,\" said Rebecca Macieira-Kaufmann, President of Citibank California. \"We continue to see strong evidence of the state's resiliency and optimism, which bodes well for the future, but current sentiment remains lukewarm.\"", "tag-6": "Optimistic about the Future", "tag-7": "At the same time, Californians \u2013 particularly San Francisco Bay Area and younger residents - remain optimistic about the future, believing that conditions will improve in the coming year. Looking ahead 12 months, 68 percent say they believe their personal financial situation will be better, up from 64 percent in the last survey; 58 percent say they believe economic conditions will improve, up from 55 percent; and 56 percent say the state will offer more job opportunities, flat from the last survey.", "tag-8": "Throughout the survey, respondents cite jobs as the most important issue affecting their view of California and its economy. Though down slightly from the last survey, 85 percent still rate job opportunities in the state as only fair or poor.

When asked reasons for wanting to leave California, respondents cite the cost of living (29 percent), scarce job opportunities (16 percent) and high taxes (15 percent).", "tag-12": "Yet California still holds a strong connection to its residents, as many show a reluctance to leave the state. Sixty-seven percent say they would stay in the state even if they had the opportunity to move out, and 58 percent say they would recommend California as a place to live to a friend or relative. Additionally, 52 percent say if they were graduating college in the next three months they would stay in California to look for a job.", "tag-13": "Regional and Age Differences", "tag-14": "The survey found significant differences among residents of Southern California and Northern California \u2013 specifically in the San Francisco Bay Area \u2013 as well as among younger and older Californians. In the most striking difference, the Citi California Pulse Index of optimism in San Francisco came in at +13, compared to +1 in San Diego and 0 in Los Angeles. Sacramento was -3 and Fresno -9, the lowest among California cities surveyed. Among the other findings:", "tag-15": "Optimism Index", "tag-16": "Overall, the Citi California Pulse Index of optimism improved from -2 in the fourth quarter of 2010 to 0 in the first quarter of 2011, moving out of negative territory. At 0, the index is on the exact middle point of all possible scores, which could range from +100 to -100. While most Californians continue to rate current economic conditions negatively, respondents' outlook on the future rose nearly across the board, which helped drive the index's rise.", "tag-17": "About the survey The Citi California Pulse\u2122 is a quarterly survey focused on California consumer and small business sentiment regarding the current and future economic environment. This poll was conducted by telephone March 25-31, 2011, among a random sample of 1,961 California residents, age 18 and older throughout the state. Interviews were conducted in both English and Spanish. The design includes interviews with cell phone respondents, 303 interviews in the San Francisco MSA, 336 interviews in the Los Angeles MSA, 308 interviews in the San Diego MSA, 303 interviews in the Sacramento MSA, and 301 interviews in the Fresno MSA. The cell phone and MSA samples are weighted to the correct proportions. The margin of error for the entire sample is approximately +/- 3.6 percentage points.
