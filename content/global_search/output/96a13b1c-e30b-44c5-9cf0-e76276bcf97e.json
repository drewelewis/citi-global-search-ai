The InterestPlus Savings Account helps customers grow their wealth further by rewarding them with higher interest rates when they plan their personal finance portfolios and look at their entire wealth management journey in a strategic and holistic manner.", "tag-4": "In addition to the base savings-account interest rates, customers will receive bonus interest rates of up to 2.5 percent per annum on their InterestPlus Savings Account depending on how they invest, protect and spend. They will also enjoy an additional bonus interest rate of 1 percent per annum if they take up a home loan with Citibank.", "tag-5": "The emerging affluent, identified as the segment from S$50,000 to S$200,000 in investible assets, is one of the fastest growing markets in Asia Pacific and Singapore. In 2011, Citibank launched a Personal Banking proposition for the emerging affluent segment as part of its strategy to serve the evolving needs of individuals who are upwardly mobile and globally minded. In addition to access to global services and easy connectivity, part of the offering included a dedicated Personal Banker or relationship manager for customers with S$50,000 to S$200,000 in assets under management (AUM).", "tag-6": "The new InterestPlus Savings Account, which is available beginning April 4, 2013, was developed as part of the Personal Banking proposition and aims to offer the next level of advisory and service as customers start and grow in affluence along their wealth journey.", "tag-7": "Mr. Umang Moondra, Managing Director and Head of Retail Banking for Citibank Singapore Ltd, said: \"At Citibank, we believe that it is important for us to walk this journey with our customers and help them grow and manage their assets. The InterestPlus Savings Account addresses the specific needs of the emerging affluent segment with its focus on rewarding customers who look holistically at their entire wealth management portfolio. The tiered bonus interest-rate structure encourages customers to put equal importance on accumulating, growing and protecting their wealth as well as how they spend and borrow, so that they will have a balanced portfolio.\"", "tag-8": "On the Emerging Affluent Segment", "tag-9": "The launch of the new proposition comes as both the number of individuals and the wealth of the emerging affluent in Singapore grow. It is estimated that there are 500,000 people in Singapore with AUM up to S$200,000, and this is expected to grow 10 percent year-on-year in the next three years. The liquid assets of customers in this segment are also anticipated to grow approximately 10 percent per year in the next three years.1", "tag-10": "Citibank's emerging affluent segment has grown steadily in the past two years. Since the launch of the Personal Banking emerging affluent proposition in 2011, there has been an increase of some 60 percent in the number of new-to-bank customers with more than S$50,000 AUM. Among this group of customers, nearly 30 percent have upgraded to the Citigold segment (with AUM of between S$200,000 and S$1 million) by their second year with the bank.", "tag-11": "The needs and preferences of the emerging affluent customers have evolved in tandem with the growth of the segment. \"In 2011, when we launched the Personal Banking proposition to cater to the emerging affluent space, we found that customers wanted a bank that values their time, immediately addresses their needs, offers world-class digital banking services and access to global banking services to complement their global lifestyles. In the past two years, our research has shown that customer needs have evolved, and emerging affluent customers are now increasingly focused on wealth advice and solutions that are client-centric and tailored for them,\" shared Mr. Moondra.", "tag-12": "Having access to holistic wealth advisory and a strategic overview of one's entire wealth management needs are important to the long-term personal finance objectives and goals. At the center of this is the ability to make informed considerations on how one invests, protects, spends and borrows. This is especially so for the emerging affluent segment.", "tag-13": "Mr. Shrikant Bhat, Head of Wealth Management for Citibank Singapore Ltd, said: \"As much as it is essential for customers to grow their wealth, it is equally important for them to understand the importance of preserving their wealth and protecting themselves. Through our experience, many customers with less than S$200,000 investible assets tend to be overly focused on interest rates and quick ways to make their money grow, and do not take a holistic or long-term view of their overall finances.\"", "tag-14": "A majority of the emerging affluent segment tends to be young professionals with a few years' working experience who are in the life stage where they are either married, getting married or planning to start a family. Many are either buying their first homes or cars, and may have conflicting financial needs and goals.", "tag-15": "Added Mr. Bhat: \"It is important for this segment of customers to have a balanced approach towards growth and protection, as they have many conflicting goals. They tend to be underinsured either because they think that they still have a lot of time or are more concerned about growing their money rather than protection. Hence, if any unexpected event occurs such as market turbulence, ill-health or unfortunate incidents, there is a risk that their investments could be wiped out.\"", "tag-16": "\"Our Personal Banking proposition and advisory service offered by Personal Bankers aim to encourage customers in this segment to look holistically at their wealth management portfolios and not at individual areas or products in isolation. The InterestPlus Savings Account brings this objective to another level, by actively promoting a well-balanced personal finance portfolio and encouraging a disciplined approach in how one allocates their available funds.\"", "tag-17": "About the InterestPlus Savings Account", "tag-18": "The InterestPlus Savings Account enables customers to earn bonus interest rates of up to 2.5 percent per annum on top of the base savings account interest rates, and an additional 1 percent per annum if they take up a home loan.", "tag-19": "The bonus interest rate is awarded based on any combination of the various categories listed above. This means that the customer can 'mix and match' between the four categories to earn bonus interest rates, based on his/her product choices.", "tag-20": "Scenario 1: A customer has an average daily balance of S$50,000 in his InterestPlus Savings Account. He decides to invest $25,000 in a lump sum unit trust, signs up for an insurance policy that requires him to pay $250 in monthly premiums and spends S$100 per month on his credit card.", "tag-21": "The customer will receive an additional 2.5 per cent per annum on his average daily balance in the InterestPlus Savings Account, on top of the base interest rate that he enjoys. This means he will enjoy additional S$1,250 interest per annum with S$50,000 average daily balance in his InterestPlus account. He then decides to buy a new home and takes a home loan with Citibank, earning him an additional bonus interest of S$500. Therefore, his total additional interest will be S$1,750.", "tag-22": "Scenario 2: A customer has an average daily balance of S$50,000 in her InterestPlus Savings Account. She signs up for an insurance policy that requires her to pay $250 in monthly premiums and spends S$100 per month on her credit card.", "tag-23": "The customer will receive an additional 1.3 percent per annum on her average daily balance in the InterestPlus Savings Account, on top of the base interest rate that she enjoys. This means she will enjoy additional S$650 interest per annum with S$50,000 average daily balance in her InterestPlus account.", "tag-24": "Details for the additional interest rate", "tag-25": "Other Personal Banking services for the Emerging Affluent Segment", "tag-26": "1 Figures are taken from DataMonitor", "tag-27": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
