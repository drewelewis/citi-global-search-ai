CBO Financial acted as financial advisor to the PRHFA in securing the NMTC allocation, placing the equity and structuring the fund.", "tag-3": "\"The PRHFA team has worked on this transaction for three long years,\" said PRHFA Executive Director George Joyner. \"To the best of our knowledge, the use of NMTC to create a revolving construction loan fund is unique for this program. We hope this transaction serves as an example for other NMTC recipients, so they, too, will use their NMTC creatively and not accept the dictum 'it has never been done' as the final word on any challenge they may face.\"", "tag-4": "The creation of the Fund fills a void created by the lack of existing traditional financing sources in the construction lending market in Puerto Rico. According to Estudios T\u00e9cnicos, a leading economic, marketing strategies and planning consulting firm based in Puerto Rico, this void has created a considerable pent-up demand of approximately 10,000 for-sale units annually to low-income individuals. The Fund's activity will be targeted to disadvantaged communities of higher economic distress, namely those with poverty rates in excess of 30 percent and unemployment rates at least 1.5 times the national average.", "tag-5": "The creation of the Puerto Rico Community Development Fund was jointly announced by Puerto Rico Governor Luis G. Fortu\u00f1o and Citi North America Chief Executive Officer, Bill Mills, during a meeting held at La Fortaleza. \"As a result of this transaction, hundreds of Puerto Rican families will be able to make their dream a reality \u2013 owning their own home,\" Gov. Fortu\u00f1o said. \"This is another example of the kind of constructive public-private partnership that has been a hallmark of our administration, and that can serve as a model for other jurisdictions throughout the nation.\"", "tag-6": "Fortu\u00f1o and Mills explained that this highly structured Fund is the first financial structure of its kind created to meet the demand of Puerto Rico's residents by supplying the capital to develop sustainable communities. The PRHFA and Citi's participation in the transaction has been arranged through a direct leveraged investment structure, with Citi serving as the tax credit equity investor and the Fund's sole owner and the PRHFA serving as the Fund's controlling entity and senior leverage lender.", "tag-7": "\"We have been in operation in Puerto Rico for more than 90 years and remain dedicated to helping the island fill a critical void in the affordable housing finance market,\" said Bill Mills, CEO of North America for Citi. \"As we expand in the region, we will continue to look for new and innovative ways to help strengthen local communities.\"", "tag-8": "The initial phase of the US$45 million fund will finance the construction of close to 800 units of affordable and social-interest for-sale housing concurrently. Assuming an average construction period of 18 - 24 months, the RLF has the ability to be recycled more than four times, possibly leveraging the US$45 million RLF to provide over US$180 million in financing and up US$225 million in total investment for the construction of over 3,000 for-sale housing units and will have a catalytic effect on job creation and supply of affordable homes for low-income families. The fund's initial phase will finance housing developments across the island, including in the municipalities of San Juan, Bayam\u00f3n, Juncos, Naguabo and Santa Isabel.", "tag-9": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
