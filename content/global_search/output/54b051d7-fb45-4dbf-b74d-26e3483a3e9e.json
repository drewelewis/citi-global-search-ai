Commencing January 1, 2023, Citi's GSIB surcharge will increase from 3.0% to 3.5%, which will be applicable to both the Standardized Approach and the Advanced Approaches, resulting in a minimum CET1 regulatory requirement of 12% under the Standardized Approach and 10.5% under the Advanced Approaches, both as of such date.

We have capacity to maintain the current common dividend of $0.51 per share in a range of stress scenarios, including the one outlined in the FRB stress test. The combination of our earnings generation, divestitures, optimization efforts and management buffer - which was designed in part to temporarily address volatility - will be important tools as we manage toward our CET1 target over the coming quarters. We are committed to executing the strategy we presented at Investor Day, improving our returns and delivering excess capital to our investors.\"", "tag-4": "A Form 8-K Current Report regarding this announcement can be found here.", "tag-5": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
