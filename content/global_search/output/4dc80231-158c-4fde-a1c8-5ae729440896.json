Nearly half of small business owners (48 percent) rate conditions as good or excellent, up from 43 percent in May 2012 and twice the rate three years ago (24 percent).

Nearly half of small business owners (48 percent) rate conditions as good or excellent, up from 43 percent in May 2012 and twice the rate three years ago (24 percent).

Half of small-business owners say they expect annual sales to grow in 2013, with one-third saying they will grow by more than 10 percent. In addition, more than half (54 percent) expect an even stronger 2014.", "tag-5": "\"The rise in those that have a favorable view of current business conditions is unmistakable,\" said Jerome Byers, head of Citibank Small Business. \"While about half still fault sales for preventing them from achieving business goals, just as many business owners project improved sales this year and next. In recent years, as conditions have improved and small businesses have looked to grow, we have sought to be there for them \u2013 our small business lending has grown annually, from $4.5 billion in 2009 to $9.6 billion last year.\"", "tag-6": "Improved Outlook Coincides with Plans for Growth With the change in outlook, 26 percent of business owners say they will hire full-time employees in the next 12 months, significantly higher than found in most Citi Pulse surveys conducted over the past three years (15 percent in Summer 2012 and 17 percent in Summers 2011 and 2010). Only 5 percent of all respondents are considering a staff reduction.", "tag-7": "Meanwhile, 13 percent say they are looking to add a new location. Among those companies, 25 percent intend to grow internationally to either an emerging or a major international market. Eighty-one percent see a new geographical market as a sales solution or business opportunity that does not exist in the current market. Among companies not expanding, 26 percent say they do not have the right staff to manage expansion.", "tag-8": "Aiding owners' interest in growth, their fears about cash and budgets have eased \u2013 59 percent are achieving or making progress toward maintaining their cash flow, compared to the 50 percent who had reported facing a cash crunch by the summer of 2012. Owners are also focusing on reducing debt \u2013 39 percent are paying off debt while another 22 percent are making progress toward a full payoff.", "tag-9": "The Need for Skills Some small businesses would like to hire, but cannot find qualified candidates (16 percent). Among these companies, 62 percent say candidates need more experience and 44 percent cannot find skilled labor. The number-one item on the action plan for all companies to achieve business goals is training employees, followed by reinventing marketing/advertising and incorporating innovative technology. Company size makes the focus on training easier, chosen by 59 percent of companies with sales revenue greater than $1 million, compared to 37 percent of companies under $1 million. v", "tag-10": "\"As conditions improve, many small businesses are planning to add staff despite some still reporting a 'skills gap' in the U.S.,\" said Byers. \"Plans for physical expansion are in the works too, including the possibility of small businesses crossing international borders \u2013 and well they should. With global services and resources to support them, no business is too small to consider international options to find suppliers or customers.\"", "tag-11": "Business Owners Still Sacrifice, But Less This year, many small business owners reported making fewer personal sacrifices to keep their businesses going and growing \u2013 64 percent took less profit to support the business versus 78 percent last year. This year, 54 percent covered several jobs because they could not afford to hire additional employees, while 67 percent were forced to cover more roles last year.

In a nod to stronger business situations, 62 percent of small business owners said they used personal savings to fund their business in 2012, yet only 37 percent dipped into their own pockets in 2013.", "tag-13": "Demonstrating the passion and commitment of small business owners, 22 percent do not ever plan to retire unless they are no longer able to work. For those who plan to retire, 40 percent expect to sell the business.", "tag-14": "About the Citibank\u00ae Small Business Pulse This Citibank survey was conducted via telephone from May 16, 2013 \u2013 May 30, 2013 by Abt SRBI Research and Public Affairs among a national random sample of 750 small business owners/operators, age 18 and older throughout the United States.
