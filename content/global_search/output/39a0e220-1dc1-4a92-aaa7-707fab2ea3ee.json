Citi is proud to partner with 3 Paralympic athletes -- two of whom, Kari Miller and Carlos Leon, are veterans. Together through the Every Step of the Way program, we are giving back to the organizations that inspired them on their Paralympic journeys so they can help others achieve excellence.\"", "tag-4": "Nearly 500 guests attended the event, including Team Citi athlete Carlos Leon, a veteran.
