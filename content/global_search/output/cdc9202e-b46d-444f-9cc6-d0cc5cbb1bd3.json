Retailers can incorporate this into their approach when marketing to millennials, whose habits may defy generalizations as they enter the next stage of their lives.\"", "tag-5": "The survey indicated that 91 percent of millennial parents feel that they consider their child's opinion when back-to-school shopping more than their parents did when they were young. This stat is revealing, and signals to retailers that new parents are increasingly leaning on their children's recommendations and input for back-to-school products.", "tag-6": "Other key findings, include:", "tag-7": "More Than Budgeting, Why Millennial Parents Choose In-Store", "tag-8": "Sticking to a budget is key, but it's not the only reason millennial parents prefer shopping in-store.

On average, they anticipate having more than a quarter (27 percent) of their back-to-school shopping left after the first day of school. Furthermore, these parents do not expect to have bought their last item until four weeks after the start date, which can mean back-to-school shopping remains a priority for parents into the fall months.", "tag-10": "Many millennial parents see value in extending the back-to-school shopping season.
