Meanwhile, among workers age 55 and older, 50% fell into that camp.", "tag-1": "Making Up for Lost Time", "tag-2": "According to a 2011 survey by the Employee Benefit Research Institute, 62% of workers ages 45 to 54 had $50,000 or less in total savings and investments. Meanwhile, among workers age 55 and older, 50% fell into that camp.", "tag-3": "Even if your nest egg is above these levels, you may not have nearly enough set aside for retirement--and it may be time to play catch-up.", "tag-4": "Those age 50 and above can do just that, thanks to the catch-up contributions they can make to Individual Retirement Accounts and to 401(k) and similar employer-sponsored retirement plans. Those 50 and older can put as much as $22,500 into a 401(k) in 2012, versus a $17,000 maximum for folks who are younger. The 50-plus crowd can also invest as much as $6,000 in an IRA, compared to $5,000 for those under age 50.", "tag-5": "Let's say you maxed out your 401(k) every year for 15 years, starting at age 50. Assuming you earned 5% a year and you were able to contribute the full $22,500 a year, you would have more than $503,000 at age 65. Any matching employer contributions would be gravy, on top of what you save.", "tag-6": "Fully funding an IRA could also add significantly to your nest egg. Once again, assume that you earned 5% a year. If you were able to contribute $6,000 a year for 15 years, you would have an extra $134,000 for retirement.", "tag-7": "INVESTMENT PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022 NNO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-8": "These strategies do not necessarily represent the experience of other clients, nor do they indicate future performance or success.
