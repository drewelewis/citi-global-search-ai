There was simply too much at stake and too much movement behind the scenes for there not to be some minimal progress. Unfortunately, even with low expectations baked-in, the Supercommittee fell well short, coming up with not even a penny of agreed upon cuts.", "tag-1": "Life After the Supercommittee", "tag-2": "Last week I was optimistic that the Supercommittee would be able to reach a deal.

According to the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), between 2013 and 2021, sequestration will mandate defense budget cuts of $454 billion, non-defense spending cuts of $294 billion, Medicare reductions of $123 billion, and other mandatory budgetary resource reductions of $47 billion.", "tag-4": "While Congress has the opportunity to avoid sequestration if they take bold steps to curb the deficit in 2012, it faces several obstacles to enacting meaningful, bipartisan reform between now and the election in November, 2012, namely:\u202a", "tag-5": "The end of 2012 will bring the \"Perfect Storm\" - an election with possible changes at all levels of government; the expiration of the Bush tax cuts which could lead to increased tax rates on all taxpayers; and defense, education, and health budgets slashed through spending cuts beginning in early 2013. Couple this with the likelihood that the debt ceiling will once again need to be increased in late 2012 or early 2013 and we have the makings of a crisis that could finally drive Congressional action."}
