First quarter 2012 results included a net gain of $477 million on minority investments ($308 million after-tax)5. Excluding CVA/DVA in both periods and the gain on minority investments in the first quarter 2012, first quarter 2013 revenues increased 3% from the prior year period to $20.8 billion. First quarter 2013 earnings were $1.29 per diluted share, representing a 16% increase from prior year earnings of $1.11 per diluted share (excluding CVA/DVA and the gain on minority investments in first quarter 2012), as higher revenues and lower net credit losses were partially offset by higher legal and related expenses, a lower loan loss reserve release and a higher effective tax rate.", "tag-5": "Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer of Citi, said: \"Achieving consistent, high-quality earnings is one of my top priorities and these results are encouraging. During the quarter, we benefitted from seasonally strong results in our markets businesses, sustained momentum in investment banking, continued year-over-year growth in loans and deposits in Citicorp, and a more favorable credit environment. However, the environment remains challenging and we are sure to be tested as we go through the year.", "tag-6": "\"In addition to our performance across business lines, there were several other areas where we made progress. We reduced the drag on earnings caused by Citi Holdings and utilized a modest amount of our deferred tax assets. Our capital strength again improved during the quarter with the Tier 1 Common Ratio increasing to an estimated 9.3% on a Basel III basis. It is critical that Citi be viewed as an indisputably strong and stable institution and we made progress towards that goal,\" Mr. Corbat concluded.", "tag-7": "Citigroup revenues of $20.8 billion in the first quarter 2013 increased 3% from the prior year period, excluding CVA/DVA and the gain on minority investments in the first quarter 2012. This increase was driven by 2% growth in Citicorp revenues and 15% growth in Citi Holdings revenues.", "tag-8": "Citicorp revenues6 of $19.6 billion in the first quarter 2013 included $(310) million of CVA/DVA reported within Securities and Banking. Citicorp revenues of $19.9 billion increased 2% from the prior year period, excluding CVA/DVA and the impact of minority investment in the first quarter 2012.

Excluding CVA/DVA, Citi Holdings revenues were $910 million, up 15% versus the prior year period. Higher revenues in the Special Asset Pool drove the improvement in Citi Holdings revenues from the prior year period reflecting lower asset marks and lower funding costs. The improvement in Special Asset Pool revenues was partially offset by a decline in Local Consumer Lending revenues, mainly due to the continuing decline in assets. Total Citi Holdings assets of $149 billion declined $60 billion, or 29%, from the first quarter 2012. Citi Holdings assets at the end of the first quarter 2013 represented approximately 8% of total Citigroup assets.", "tag-10": "Citigroup's net income rose to $3.8 billion in the first quarter 2013 from $2.9 billion in the prior year period. Excluding the impact of CVA/DVA and the gain on minority investments in the first quarter of 2012, Citigroup net income increased 17% to $4.0 billion. This increase was driven by revenue growth and lower net credit losses, partially offset by higher expenses, a lower loan loss reserve release and a higher effective tax rate. Operating expenses of $12.4 billion were 1% higher than the prior year period mainly reflecting an increase in legal and related costs and repositioning charges. Citigroup's cost of credit in the first quarter 2013 was $2.5 billion, a decrease of 16% over the prior year period, reflecting a $994 million improvement in net credit losses partially offset by a $513 million decline in net loan loss reserve releases. The higher effective tax rate reflected both higher earnings in North America as well as a higher tax rate on international operations due to a first quarter 2013 change in the assertion that earnings in certain international entities would be permanently reinvested outside the U.S.", "tag-11": "Citigroup's allowance for loan losses was $23.7 billion at quarter end, or 3.7% of total loans, compared to $29.0 billion, or 4.5% of total loans, at the end of the prior year period. The loan loss reserve release of $652 million in the quarter was down 44% from the prior year period. Reserve releases in Citicorp of $301 million compared to $589 million in the first quarter 2012, predominantly reflecting lower releases in North America GCB, largely related to Citi-branded cards. Citi Holdings recorded a net loan loss reserve release of $351 million in the first quarter 2013, compared to a net reserve release of $576 million in the prior year period, which included approximately $350 million of reserve releases related to previously deferred principal balances on modified mortgages. Citigroup asset quality remained largely stable to improving in the first quarter 2013 as total non-accrual assets fell 9% to $11.1 billion compared to the first quarter 2012. Corporate non-accrual loans decreased 16% to $2.5 billion from the first quarter 2012, while consumer non-accrual loans decreased 5% to $8.1 billion. The decline in consumer non-accrual loans occurred despite the third quarter 2012 OCC guidance regarding the treatment of mortgage loans where the borrower has gone through Chapter 7 bankruptcy which added $1.5 billion to consumer non-accrual loans. Consumer loans that were 90+ days delinquent, excluding the Special Asset Pool, declined 26% versus the prior year period to $6.6 billion, or 1.7% of consumer loans.", "tag-12": "Citigroup's capital levels and book value per share increased versus the prior year period. As of quarter end, book value per share was $62.51 and tangible book value per share was $52.35, 1% and 3% increases respectively versus the prior year period. At quarter end, Citigroup's Basel I Tier 1 Capital Ratio was 13.1% and its Basel I Tier 1 Common Ratio was 11.8%, each reflecting the final U.S. market risk capital rules (Basel II.5) which became effective on January 1, 2013.

Excluding CVA/DVA and the gain on minority investments in first quarter 2012, revenues were $19.9 billion, up 2% from the first quarter 2012 driven by 8% growth in Securities and Banking revenues to $7.3 billion while GCB revenues were flat at $10.0 billion and CTS revenues declined 4% to $2.6 billion.

The increase reflected lower loan loss reserve releases, which declined 49% to $301 million, partially offset by lower net credit losses, which declined 9% to $2.0 billion compared to the prior year period. The decline in reserve releases was largely in North America GCB and primarily related to Citi-branded cards. Citicorp's consumer loans 90+ days delinquent declined 12% from the prior year period to $2.9 billion, and the 90+ days delinquency ratio decreased 15 basis points to 1.02% of loans.", "tag-18": "Citicorp end of period loans grew 5% versus the prior year period to $539 billion, reflecting growth in corporate loans and Latin America consumer loans.

Retail banking revenues declined 3% to $1.6 billion from the first quarter 2012, primarily reflecting the ongoing impact of spread compression, partially offset by higher volumes. Mortgage banking volumes remained strong, although margins declined versus the prior year period. Citi-branded cards revenues declined 1% to $2.0 billion, reflecting lower average loan balances as Citi-branded cards loans declined 5% partially offset by an improvement in net interest spreads. Citi retail services revenues increased 1% to $1.5 billion driven by improved net interest spreads that were partially offset by a 2% decline in average loans versus the prior year period. Citi retail services revenues were also negatively impacted by higher contractual partner payments due to the impact of improving credit trends.", "tag-22": "North America GCB net income was $1.1 billion, 14% lower than the first quarter 2012. The decline in net income was driven by slightly lower revenues, higher operating expenses and a reduction in loan loss reserve release, partially offset by lower net credit losses. Operating expenses in the first quarter were up 4% versus the prior year period to $2.4 billion reflecting volume related growth and higher repositioning charges, partially offset by efficiency savings.", "tag-23": "North America GCB credit quality continued to improve as net credit losses declined 23% to $1.3 billion compared to the prior year period.

The decline in revenues in Asia reflected the continued low interest rate environment and ongoing regulatory changes in the region.", "tag-25": "International GCB net income declined 5% from the prior year period to $833 million as revenue growth was negatively offset by higher operating expenses and cost of credit, as well as a higher effective tax rate.
