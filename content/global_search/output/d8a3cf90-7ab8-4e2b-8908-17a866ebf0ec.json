At the first four events--in Baltimore, Orlando, Cleveland and Atlanta--nearly 65 percent of attendees qualified for loan modification programs. Many have been helped even in late stages of delinquency--95 percent of attendees were 60 days or more delinquent on their mortgage payments and 50 percent were already in the foreclosure process.", "tag-4": "Borrowers who are unable or do not wish to remain in their homes can discuss alternative programs to ease their housing transition. These include short sales, in which the property is marketed and sold for less than the outstanding mortgage balance. Deed-in-lieu is another option, where the borrower turns over the deed to the mortgage company. In both instances, the consumer is able to avoid the difficult foreclosure process.", "tag-5": "The tour is a part of Citi's ongoing commitment to serving the communities we call home. CitiMortgage CEO Sanjiv Das says: \"At CitiMortgage, our number one priority is to help our customers avoid foreclosure and stay in their homes. In the majority of cases at these events, we are accomplishing that. We are meeting one-on-one with homeowners - many of whom have never been in touch with us -- in comfortable local venues to discuss specific assistance solutions available to them. Together, in respectful, private conversations, we are able to explore a variety of ways to help.\"", "tag-6": "In addition to the locations mentioned above, events have been held in Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Miami and Detroit. The final Tour events will be held in Phoenix on June 10th and Dallas on June 14th.", "tag-7": "For information, or for those who are unable to attend events but would like assistance, please call 1-866-915-9417 or visit https://blog.citimortgage.com."}
