Year-to-date, Citigroup has decreased its outstanding long-term debt by approximately $11.9 billion through these initiatives, including the previously announced redemptions of trust preferred securities and assuming the completion of these Offers. Coupled with the ongoing natural maturing of long-term debt that requires no refinancing, these initiatives result in lower borrowing costs and reduce the overall level of Citigroup's long-term debt outstanding. Citigroup will continue to consider opportunities to repurchase its long-term as well as short-term debt based on several factors, including without limitation the economic value, potential impact on Citigroup's net interest margin and borrowing costs and the overall remaining tenor of its debt portfolio.", "tag-4": "Citigroup also announced today the related increase in the Maximum Series Tender Cap for each series of Notes subject to the Offers, such increased Maximum Series Tender Caps as set forth in the table below, and further extended each of the Early Tender Date, the Expiration Date and the Settlement Date.
