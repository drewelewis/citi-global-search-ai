But in fact, assets in college-savings plans have jumped 56% over the 24 months through year-end 2010, according to Financial Research Corp.

You may also get a break on state taxes, but to qualify you will likely have to fund an in-state 529 plan.", "tag-4": "Single individuals can contribute up to $13,000 a year to a 529 plan without worrying about the gift tax or a lump sum of $65,000 in the first year of a five-year period.
