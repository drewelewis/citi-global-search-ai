While there is real momentum behind vaccine distribution in the U.S., we know that frequent testing is one of the best tools we have at our disposal today for helping to decrease the transmission of COVID-19. Until vaccines are widely available and large numbers of individuals are fully vaccinated across the U.S., rapid, at-home testing provides an opportunity for early identification of infection, which is key to breaking the chain of transmission of COVID-19.", "tag-1": "Bringing rapid at-home COVID-19 testing to our U.S. colleagues", "tag-2": "It's remarkable to be approaching the one-year mark of COVID-19 impacting the way we work and live.

We have many colleagues who aren't able to do their roles remotely who have continued to work onsite through the pandemic. Our team follows safety measures, including daily health screenings, masking, social distancing and frequent handwashing, and we are excited to introduce a new mitigant strategy for our colleagues to prevent the spread of the virus.", "tag-4": "We are now offering the opportunity to participate in a rapid at-home COVID-19 testing clinical study to some of our U.S. colleagues who continue to be working in our branches and offices. This at-home COVID-19 testing program uses a rapid antigen test, which provides results within 20 minutes. The science is clear: frequent use of low-cost, simple, rapid tests is highly effective in identifying people who are currently infectious, even if they are asymptomatic.", "tag-5": "We are offering colleagues at our Chicago area branches, as well as on our trading floors at our global headquarters in New York, the opportunity to participate in this study to help enhance learnings around COVID-19 testing when it is self-administered frequently at home by non-medical professionals.", "tag-6": "Citi is thrilled to be part of this groundbreaking effort, and we will use the learnings from this initial pilot to inform Citi's broader plans around at-home testing and our future return to office strategy. Our intent is to make at-home testing widely available to more colleagues in the coming months as an additional measure to enhance workplace health and safety.", "tag-7": "Update: Citi completed its COVID-19 at-home rapid antigen test pilot program at the end of April and has transitioned to providing an FDA-approved rapid antigen test for U.S. colleagues."}
