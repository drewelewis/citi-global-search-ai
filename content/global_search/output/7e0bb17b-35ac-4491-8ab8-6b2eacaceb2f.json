Female banking executives from more than 15 institutions attended the seminar held at the Kempinski Ixir Hotel.", "tag-4": "Keynote speaker HH Shaikha Hessa bint Khalifa Al Khalifa, Chairwoman of Al Salam Bank and Executive Director of inJAz Bahrain, spoke on the role of women in the banking and financial sector, pointing out that it is the largest single employer in the Kingdom, with more than 14,400 people and with women making up 37 percent of that workforce. \"However, the majority of that percentile hold only junior to middle management roles,\" she said.", "tag-5": "Shaikha Hessa went on to underline the need for a diverse workforce: \"Women in the workplace, in particular in the banking sector, continue to be dismally represented, especially in more senior banking roles. It is clear that women aren't currently progressing as far, or as high, as their male counterparts. This is not only a local issue, but is also an epidemic that is spread across the globe.\"", "tag-6": "She listed the challenges facing women in the financial sector as being: the prevailing attitude towards women; an existing male-dominated workforce; the organizational culture and a lack of female role models. Shaikha Hessa concluded with a call for proactive initiatives to counter the challenges to women's career progression in banking. She added: \"The biggest challenge that women face in their career advancement in banking today is not about organizational processes, but is about awareness, attitudes and the culture of the organization. These issues ought to be changed if banks wish to achieve gender diversification at senior levels. This will call for a sizeable shift in both organizational, social culture and attitudes.\"", "tag-7": "The roundtable was also addressed by Mrs. Sabah Khalil Al Moayyed, herself a banker with three decades of experience in the financial sector, most recently as Chief Executive Officer and a Board Member of Eskan Bank, a post she relinquished only last month.
