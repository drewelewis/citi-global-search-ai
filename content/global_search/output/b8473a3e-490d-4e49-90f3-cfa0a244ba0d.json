Since that time, thousands of our colleagues have become part of the fabric of the neighborhood and watched it transform into the bustling, vibrant community it is today. While our company and its needs have changed over time, our appreciation and affection for this neighborhood have only grown stronger. As we have been consolidating our people in our global headquarters in Tribeca, we have still maintained a significant presence in Long Island City.", "tag-5": "\"But given what it would mean to New York and Long Island City to have Amazon establish a significant presence here, we want to do our part to make this possible. We have committed to vacate certain floors at One Court Square early and move about 1,100 of the colleagues who presently work there to alternate locations, including in Long Island City and our Tribeca headquarters. As a company that has been based here since our founding 206 years ago, we couldn't be happier to welcome Amazon to the great City of New York,\" Mr. Corbat concluded.", "tag-6": "CitiCiti, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
