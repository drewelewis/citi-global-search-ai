The aim of the program was to increase income levels of impoverished rural artisan household enterprises in Guizhou Province by enhancing their production and marketing skills of traditional handicraft as well as to protect and inherit the traditional culture the handicraft imbedded in. Through strong collaboration among corporations, grass-root non-profit organizations and government, the program sought to create a sustainable development model for impoverished villages to reap economic, environmental and social benefits.", "tag-5": "Andrew Au said: \"We are pleased to support this program for the fourth consecutive year. Guizhou is an important part of Citi's network within China, and we hope to help ensure the sustainability of its economy and the prosperity of the community in a positive, effective and suitable way. This is why we chose to help them promoting Guizhou Miao traditional handicrafts, a national cultural heritage with important artistic and market value.\"", "tag-6": "Professor Ren Xiaodong added: \"The project bridged the gap between craftwork artisans and market demand by means of supporting the local cultural heritage, calling on partnerships with corporations, and building the capabilities in ethnic minority areas.

We are extremely grateful to Citi Foundation for supporting the project and developing the Guizhou community.\"", "tag-7": "Danzhai County is one of the most poverty-stricken counties in China with an average annual income per capita below 2,300 Renminbi (US$372) in its poorest villages.
