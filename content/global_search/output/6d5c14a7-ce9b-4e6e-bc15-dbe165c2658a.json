Given the strong position that Citi is in today, I have concluded that the time has come for me to take my leave. Together with the rest of the Board of Directors, I have complete confidence in the management team, the actions they have taken to strengthen Citi, and the course they have charted for the future of one of the world's truly great financial institutions.
