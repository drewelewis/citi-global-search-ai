The events were particularly helpful in reaching clients who had not previously sought assistance. More than 30 percent of attendees were first-time responders. Almost 90 percent of attendees were 60 days or more past due on their mortgage payments and 30 percent were in foreclosure. Still, nearly 60 percent of those attending qualified for a mortgage modification.", "tag-5": "Sanjiv Das, President and CEO of CitiMortgage, said: \"Our initial outreach efforts with the Road to Recovery program were extremely successful in helping homeowners. As we began moving into the next phase of the program, we recognized a very immediate need to help homeowners in areas hard hit by Hurricane Irene. So, we are focusing a good deal of our initial attention on those areas.\"", "tag-6": "The events, offering one-on-one consultations with mortgage-assistance experts, provide meetings in private, curtained-off settings. In the first round of events, 96 percent of attendees rated the experience as excellent or good, and 97 percent said they were very likely or likely to recommend the experience to a friend, based on exit surveys.", "tag-7": "During the autumn phase of the tour, Citi expects to reach homeowner clients at 15 events across the U.S.", "tag-8": "Upcoming \"Road to Recovery\" Events:", "tag-9": "From 2007 through 2010, Citi has helped more than 1.1 million homeowners in their efforts to avoid potential foreclosure and remain in their homes. Borrowers who are unable or do not wish to remain in their homes can discuss alternative programs to ease their housing transition. These include short sales, in which the property is marketed and sold for less than the outstanding mortgage balance. Deed-in-lieu is another option, where the borrower turns over the deed to the mortgage company. In both instances, the consumer is able to avoid the difficult foreclosure process.", "tag-10": "For information, or for those who are unable to attend events but would like assistance, please call 1-866-915-9417 or visit http://blog.citimortgage.com.", "tag-11": "Citi Citi, the leading global financial services company, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
