In 2012's second quarter, home prices were 1.2% higher than a year earlier, according to S&P/Case-Shiller's national composite home-price index.", "tag-3": "That's a far cry from the heady days of the housing bubble. Still, that doesn't mean a home can't be a way to build wealth even as it puts a roof over your head. But if you are tempted to buy your first home, trade up to a larger place or perhaps purchase a vacation property, you should probably think carefully about time horizon--because it can take many years of price gains to make up for the costs of first buying and later selling a home.", "tag-4": "As a buyer, your expenses can include home-inspection costs, mortgage-application fees, a title search, legal fees and moving costs, plus the costs of any initial repairs and redecorating. But it's selling that can really sting: Your expenses might include legal fees and any fixing up needed to make the place attractive. But the biggest hit will be the real-estate brokerage commission, which could be 5% or 6% of the selling price.", "tag-5": "Add it all up, and the roundtrip cost to buy and then sell a home could be 10% of a home's value. It might take five years to recoup that cost, assuming modest home-price gains. The bottom line: Before buying a home, you probably want to be reasonably confident that you'll stay put for at least that long--and preferably longer.", "tag-6": "INVESTMENT PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022 NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-7": "\u00a9 2012 Citigroup Inc.
