(\"Citi China\") announced the launch of a multi-currency notional pooling with RMB capability, making it the first bank in China to offer a tool of this kind under its liquidity management product offering.", "tag-3": "As one of the most advanced liquidity management solutions available to companies, multi-currency notional pooling is widely used at international financial centers such as London and Singapore. Often adopted by corporate treasury centers to efficiently manage cash flow from a centralized location, the solution can also help corporates manage cash in multiple currencies as a single position without altering FX exposures or having to perform FX swaps.", "tag-4": "Yigen Pei, Country Head of Citi's Transaction Services for China, said: \"Citi is very excited to be launching this milestone offering to our clients in China. The multi-currency notional pooling feature is a leading cash management tool and will significantly enhance the efficiency of our clients' liquidity management. The introduction of RMB capability further underlines the importance of RMB as a strategic currency in treasury management and should also help promote Shanghai's position as an international financial center.\"", "tag-5": "With the multi-currency notional pooling solution, each account retains autonomy within the pool. The currency and account type of balances do not change and balances in different currencies are not co-mingled, but notionally aggregated. By doing so, corporate treasury centers can effectively leverage internal funding across currencies and in turn, benefit from FX cost reductions and increased operational efficiencies.", "tag-6": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions. Citi provides consumers, corporations, governments and institutions with a broad range of financial products and services, including consumer banking and credit, corporate and investment banking, securities brokerage, transaction services, and wealth management.", "tag-7": "Additional information may be found at www.citigroup.com | Twitter: @Citi | YouTube: www.youtube.com/citi | Blog: http://blog.citigroup.com | Facebook: www.facebook.com/citi | LinkedIn: www.linkedin.com/company/citi"}
