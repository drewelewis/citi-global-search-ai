With those subsidies nearly rescinded in 2008, the co-op board tapped advisers to develop a plan, secure funding and manage a major renovation and upgrades.", "tag-4": "Citi Community Capital played a key role in helping the co-op board leverage an initial $5 million loan from the SFRA to secure full funding -- more than $40 million -- for the project, using a financing strategy that preserved the residents' ownership stake in the housing. That funding allowed for crucial repairs to the 13 buildings/211 units across the two-block development, such as roof and window replacement and complete interior rehabilitation to floors, kitchen cabinets and appliances, and bathrooms.", "tag-5": "\"This is really a transformation from something that was in dire need of repair to something that is beautiful and neighborhood-stabilizing,\" said Steven Fayne, Managing Director, Citi Community Capital in a video on Citi's YouTube channel. \"This will be a major factor in the stabilization of this whole Western Addition [of San Francisco].\""}
