The savings in the dual banking accounts of the families \u2013 namely the parents and child \u2013 will be matched to inculcate and encourage the habit of saving early, especially for the young. South West CDC will provide an initial deposit of $100 into a Basic Banking Account for the parent and $20 into a Junior Savings Account for the child to kick-start the program for these families. The savings will be tracked over six months, upon which they will be matched dollar-for-dollar up to $100 for the child's account and up to $300 for the parents' account. In addition, they can receive up to $240 worth of incentive food vouchers.", "tag-5": "Sixty staff from Citi Singapore will volunteer as mentors for this program with two mentors attached to each family. These mentors will meet with their families at the start and tail end of the program to share basic financial planning skills and encourage them as they save towards their monthly savings target.

The first batch of 25 families will start on the program in January while the second batch of families will commence the program in mid-2013.", "tag-6": "Mayor Khor, South West district, said: \"South West CDC is pleased to partner Citi Singapore to provide upstream intervention to needy families.

Fifty families under the Work Support (WS) Program and Home Ownership Plus Education (HOPE) scheme, with children between the ages of 7 and 16, will each undergo a six-month structured program comprising of three key components. Firstly, each family will undergo a mentoring program with Citi staff volunteers who will impart financial literacy skills and encourage the families to save. Secondly, incentives in the form of stationery and food vouchers will be provided to the families throughout the programs to motivate their efforts. Thirdly, this program will provide matched savings for dual accounts namely Junior Savings Account and Basic Banking Account to help the family build financial assets to prepare for rainy days.
