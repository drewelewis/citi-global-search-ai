Citigroup is well-positioned for continued profitability and growth, having refocused the franchise on the basics of banking. Given the progress we have made in the last few years, I have concluded that now is the right time for someone else to take the helm at Citigroup. I could not be leaving the Company in better hands.

I look forward to working with our talented management team and dedicated employees to chart that future course.\"", "tag-10": "Mr. Corbat added: \"I also wish to extend my personal appreciation to Vikram for all he has achieved.
