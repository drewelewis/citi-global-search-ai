Not only are more women than men employed in careers that differ from what they thought they would do when graduating college (45 percent vs. 36 percent), but women are also more likely than men to think that they will work in a totally different industry or at a different company in 10 years (30 percent vs. 19 percent). Despite their different career paths, a nearly equal number of women and men (47 percent and 48 percent, respectively) feel they have achieved their personal goals \u2013 and the number of women who consider themselves successful has increased nearly 10 points since March 2013 (47 percent vs. 37 percent).", "tag-5": "\"The survey results illustrate how women are willing to take risks when it comes to their careers \u2013 they're thinking creatively about their paths, their definitions of success, and are prepared to reinvent themselves in order to achieve their goals,\" said Linda Descano, CFA\u00ae, Head of Content and Social, North America Marketing at Citi, and President and CEO of Women & Co., Citi's personal finance resource for women. \"Whether they need advice on how to navigate a major career transition, or are seeking support and inspiration from other women who have achieved success, the community that we have built through Connect continues to provide women with the resources they need to power their personal and professional progress.\"", "tag-6": "On work-life balance and \"having it all\" \u2013 women and men weigh in:", "tag-7": "\"Discussions about work/life balance continue to be some of the most popular conversations in Connect, so it's fascinating that the study shows that men place just as much value on it as women,\" said Jacky Carter, LinkedIn Community Manager for Connect: Professional Women's Network. \"What really surprised us in the results of the study is that men don't see money as the source of having it all \u2013 they actually place the highest value on family.\"", "tag-8": "On professional self-perception, by gender and generation:", "tag-9": "On top sources of stress and financial concerns:", "tag-10": "For more detailed results on the Today's Professional Woman Report, visit the Women & Co. blog.
