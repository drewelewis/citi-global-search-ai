While 2014 is about growth [especially U.S. growth] and improvement of the global economic environment; the performance of financial markets will remain volatile as it adjusts to growth and normalization.", "tag-4": "\"The U.S. economy is strengthening and there are signs that other major economies are stabilizing and showing relative strength. Based on the data we have seen towards the end of last year plus the fact that most of the headwinds from the fiscal side tapering off, we should see the momentum from last year continue into 2014. On the heels of that, we will get tapering from the Fed, and the two consequence of this is going to be higher bond yields and probably stronger U.S. dollar.\"", "tag-5": "\"We will continue to face headwinds and uncertainties, and these will be from the usual sources, such as liquidity fears, rising bond yields, European debt, Chinese reforms and growth, and of course geopolitics, such as tensions between Japan and China, North Korea, etc. As we get concerned about tapering and its impact, we will need to adjust as the global economy transitions to growth,\" explained Haren Shah, Chief Investment Strategist for Wealth Management, Citi Asia Pacific.", "tag-6": "Speaking at the media briefing in Kuala Lumpur today, Haren said that U.S. consumers are also beginning to feel confident again as the employment picture improves and the housing sector rebounds.", "tag-7": "In Europe, recovery will take place in hard hit peripheral economies, although Germany will drive the primary growth as it takes a more growth oriented approach. It is expected that the Eurozone will look more towards growth rather than austerity in 2014 as it tries to spur growth and recovery in hard hit countries.", "tag-8": "As for China, reforms could result in slower growth in the first half of 2014 but a recovery in the global economy will help it revive growth and keep overall GDP growth between 7-7.5 percent.", "tag-9": "\"On Emerging Markets (EM) Asian currencies, their relative strength will be dictated by their current account positions. Last year when tapering was first mentioned, we saw a broad based selloff of EM currencies. However, there was a distinction \u2013 countries with twin deficits continued to remain weak yet those with surplus actually saw their currencies rise. This was especially true in North Asian countries as their economies benefit from an improving global economy. In the first half on 2014, expect some further pressure on Indian Rupee, Indo Rupiah and the Thai Baht as the also have political uncertainties of elections,\" added Haren.", "tag-10": "In terms of EM equities, the key to their performance is their valuations and their ability to benefit from the improving global economy. Here is where we see better opportunities in the likes of those regions that will see their exports improve as growth picks up in Japan, Europe and the U.S. Current export trends are showing that exports to Developed Markets (DM) from EM countries are turning up, and if the U.S. consumers continue to spend, the outlook for especially Asia looks positive.", "tag-11": "\"Overall we remain bullish on global equities with positive returns expected for all regions. On a relative basis, we are cautious near term on the U.S. as the fundamentals need to play catch-up plus any tapering could see short term adjustment in the markets. For the full year we see more upside. Best upside is seen for U.K., Japan and Asian markets,\" Haren said, cautioning investors that there would see a diverse performance in Asia as North Asia may outperform the ASEAN region on tapering fears.", "tag-12": "Within equities, DM will remain strong but our preference at least for the first half will be Europe (U.K., Germany) and Japan on 'follow the liquidity' argument. As for U.S. equities, growth and cyclical sectors will do well but this is likely to be more of a second-half story. Within EM, focus on countries that are showing value and benefits from economic recovery. This is Hong Kong, China, Korea and Taiwan, North Asia versus ASEAN.", "tag-13": "As for bonds, even though we are underweight, from a portfolio asset allocation perspective our preference is for high yield bonds as they tend to hold up better in rising yield environments. Keep your duration short.", "tag-14": "The year 2014 is likely when we will start the process of normalizing but there will be headwinds and uncertainties along the way. Expect volatility and at times doubts about the recovery.", "tag-15": "Takeaways for 2014 (in summary)", "tag-16": "Disclaimers:", "tag-17": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
