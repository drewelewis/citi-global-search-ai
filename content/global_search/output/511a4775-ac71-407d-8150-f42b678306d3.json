They themselves describe the way their thinking evolved, how they started the program thinking that banking is just about deposits, withdrawals and a few branches. When they finish the program they understand much more about how a bank operates, and they learn that decision-making is the most important element of a profitable business and everything they will go on to do in life. Their success will depend on it.", "tag-11": "\"My group this year was very special,\" La Cruz continued. \"They really wanted to win, and they were very eager to learn and participate.
