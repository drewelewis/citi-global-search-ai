What If Your Imagination Is Wrong?", "summary": "Suppose the U.S. economy falls back into recession. Or loose monetary policy leads to renewed inflation. Or Europe can't solve its economic problems. Investors often fret that a particular economic or political scenario will come to pass--and they position their portfolio to sidestep the imagined calamity and perhaps even turn a handsome profit.", "tag-1": "Imagining Disaster?

First, stock and bonds prices ought to reflect investors' current expectations. If many folks are convinced the economy will sink back into recession, this belief may already be reflected in market prices, so investors won't necessarily profit if they change their investment strategy now.", "tag-4": "Second, investments that fare well in one scenario may falter in another situation. For example, consider \"hard assets\" such as gold, commodities and real estate. If inflation picks up, prices of hard assets could rise, as nervous investors may shift money into investments that have historically held up well during inflationary times.", "tag-5": "But if you're nervous that inflation will take off and you bet heavily on hard assets, you could face big losses should your forecast turn out to be wrong. If instead of renewed inflation, we got an economic slowdown and maybe even deflation, hard assets may have particularly bad performance.", "tag-6": "The lesson: Rather than focusing largely or exclusively on investments that might dazzle in one particular scenario, we should probably strive to build more diverse portfolios that will fare reasonably well, no matter what the future brings.", "tag-7": "INVESTMENT PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022 NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-8": "The information provided is solely for informational purposes.
