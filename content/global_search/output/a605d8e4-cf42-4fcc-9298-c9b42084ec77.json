It made a fresh start, creating an entirely new entity -- the Massachusetts Department of Transportation (MassDOT) -- to manage and operate the state's highways, local roads, bridges and other transportation assets on a more efficient basis.", "tag-1": "Moving MassDOT forward.", "tag-2": "In 2009, Massachusetts marked an important turning point when it signed into law a series of reforms aimed at improving the administration of the state's transportation infrastructure.

A solution lay in a recapitalizing and restructuring nearly $2 billion in fixed and variable rate bonds issued by the MassDOT's predecessor, effectively refinancing the bonds for a much lower cost.", "tag-4": "Indeed, the deal, achieved with bond ratings upgrades, lowered the all-in cost of funds for MassDOT by 4 percent per year, for an annual reduction in debt service of nearly $38 million. It also provided approximately $400 million for critically needed capital improvements on the Massachusetts Highway System, including essential improvements to Massachusetts Turnpike's interchange with Route 128, one of Boston's high-tech corridors, and to the B.U. Viaduct segment of the Massachusetts Turnpike in the Allston-Brighton-Cambridge area.", "tag-5": "It is great to be part of an effort that helps MassDOT source financing at a lower cost, reinvest in its roads, bridges and tunnels and realize the benefit of its comprehensive reform. This work is truly changing the way transportation services are delivered in Massachusetts -- for the better. We play similar roles in hundreds of infrastructure projects that help sustain and improve communities across the United States.", "tag-6": "Citi Municipal Securities is proud to have underwritten more of America's public projects in the past decade than any other U.S. bank."}
