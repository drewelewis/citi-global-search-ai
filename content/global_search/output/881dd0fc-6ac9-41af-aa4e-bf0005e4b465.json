By the following year, over 60 financial institutions were adhering to the principles. When making many project-finance decisions, Citi takes the sustainability issue into account. In May 2007, for example, the company announced a $50-billion, 10-year initiative to finance, and invest in, low-carbon projects and technologies. As part of this initiative, in the United States, Citi helped finance five photovoltaic systems across four campuses in the Los Angeles Community College District (LACCD), in California. The result was a reduction in the cost of electricity of up to 15 percent.", "tag-8": "In China, Citi was a joint bookrunner for the initial public offering, on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, of China's second-biggest maker of wind turbines, Xinjiang Goldwind Science & Technology Co.
