A component of Citi's \"Stretching Your Ringgit\" financial education series, \"My First Ringgit\" aims to reach 800 kindergarten children between the ages of four and six in both urban and rural areas in Malaysia.", "tag-4": "Launched at Kinderland Mutiara Damansara, this is the second year \"My First Ringgit\" is being organized; it was introduced in October 2011.", "tag-5": "Findings from a recent study conducted by Citi and ERA Consumer indicate that financial education should begin as soon as children are able to recognize the value of money. The study also found that children today have greater direct and indirect spending power and have a major influence on their parent's spending habits and patterns. Interestingly, the study revealed that most pre-school children think money comes from the bank, instead of their parents who work and earn a living.", "tag-6": "\"These are very interesting views from our four- to six-year-olds; they see money not as something that has to be earned but rather as something that is readily available from a bank. At Citi, we believe that understanding the basics of money management has no age limit,\" said Sanjeev Nanavati, Chief Executive Officer of Citibank Berhad.", "tag-7": "\"Children who understand the value of money, and more importantly, the differences between needs and wants, become more financially aware. Through the 'My First Ringgitt' program, we want to provide young Malaysians with good financial management skills to help shape their attitude towards money and put them on the right road to a positive financial future,\" he added.", "tag-8": "In the workshops, the children will learn how to manage personal finances, make calculated choices and act responsibly through a fun and informative game kit available in English and Bahasa Malaysia. The game kit touches on the topics of various uses of money, the value of each note and coin, understanding the differences between needs and wants and the importance of saving and sharing with those in need.", "tag-9": "\"Financial education should begin with children. Only then can we shape the appropriate financial attitudes and skills towards more responsible financial habits and behaviors at a later age,\" said Datuk Marimuthu Nadason, President of ERA Consumer.", "tag-10": "Results of the program held in 2011 show that there was a marked improvement in the financial knowledge and behavior of the 600 children who participated, as 40.5 percent of the children displayed an increase in knowledge in critical areas with a 20 percent increase in their basic financial knowledge score. For example, pre-schoolers were able to distinguish between the cost of two ice creams, indicating that they are able to recognize and understand the amount of money needed to purchase an item.", "tag-11": "Twenty-five percent of the parents that took part in the workshops also reported improvement in their children's financial behavior.", "tag-12": "Sanjeev added, \"We believe that there is a clear need for financial education in Malaysia. Families need to be able to budget well and save accordingly and the only way to do this is to have the support of everyone in the family. Our results from the workshops indicate we now have a clear method on how we can help improve financial literacy levels among both parents and their children, particularly those in the low to middle income groups.\"", "tag-13": "The \"Stretching Your Ringgit\" financial education series is funded by the Citi Foundation. Apart from \"My First Ringgit,\" the series will also reach out to young workers through financial education workshops and a major radio infomercial campaign.", "tag-14": "Twenty financial education workshops targeted at 800 young workers between the ages of 18 and 35 have been organized across 10 states in Peninsular Malaysia, from October 2012 until January 2013. In partnership with Astro, a total of 168 radio infomercials are also being aired on Hitz.fm, Era FM and My FM from October 3-31, 2012, in a continuing effort to increase awareness and to further encourage the practice of financial management amongst the low to middle income groups.", "tag-15": "This is the fourth year Citi is collaborating with ERA Consumer to spread the message of financial responsibility to Malaysians.", "tag-16": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
