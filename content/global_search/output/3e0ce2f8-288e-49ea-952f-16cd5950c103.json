Growing up, I've been very aware of the positive impact doctors make on people's lives and decided that's the kind of profound impact I want to have on others. As I changed over the years and learned more about the profession, this goal became more appealing. However, I never really took the time to learn about other professions. My experience with the digital communications and social media team at Citi was the first time I stepped out of my comfort zone and it ended up making me rethink my career path. I was a little skeptical going in, but once I started, I was more than surprised. There's more to the banking world than I realized. I absolutely loved everything about interning at Citi; the tasks I had at hand and the people I worked with were all so kind and supportive. I now realize that there are other things that I would enjoy doing for the rest of my life, that do not necessarily relate to medicine.", "tag-1": "Interning at Citi: A Pencil Fellows' Story", "tag-2": "Before my internship with Citi, if someone told me that working at a bank would be interesting, I would have disagreed.

In my opinion, interning and working each result in two completely different experiences. As someone with a few previous jobs, I can say that in comparison to a job, interning provides an enriched platform for growth and learning, especially interning as a PENCIL Fellow. PENCIL Fellows is an elite program that provides New York City high school students with fundamental career readiness training concluding with a summer internship at a leading business. As a fellow, I was able to participate in trainings on corporate etiquette, office technology, interview techniques, time management, personal branding, \"elevator conversation,\" and more. These trainings undeniably played a big role in my success at Citi.", "tag-4": "I feel extremely appreciative to have been chosen for this internship. My main tasks at Citi were to create a testimonial YouTube video and external survey to gather feedback on the CitiBike program, as well as how people perceive Citi for being the sponsor. At first, I was overwhelmed because of the vast information and number of people involved with the CitiBike program. However, I learned to prioritize tasks, which made my project more manageable. This is one of the many skills I developed at Citi that can be applicable to many areas of my life.", "tag-5": "To my surprise, my favorite part of the internship was not riding a bike for the first time in many years. Rather, I most enjoyed the unique opportunity to be exposed to many different teams at Citi, learning more about the company each day. While creating the YouTube video, I learned about the CitiBike program, video production, legalities and video editing. I also conducted on the street interviews with random CitiBike users. For an initially shy person like me, this was a completely new experience! While creating the external survey, I was able to brush up on skills I learned from a previous AP Statistics course, such as developing research plans, conducting surveys and analyzing data results.", "tag-6": "The most important advice I would give someone interested in completing an internship is to seize as many opportunities as possible to help develop your character and shape your future. All in all, I am immensely grateful for the opportunity Citi and PENCIL have provided me and sad that my time with them is over. I can only hope I was as valuable a resource and influence to them as they were to me.", "tag-7": "For your viewing pleasure, here is the CitiBike video I produced. Thank you, Citi and PENCIL, for all the support and guidance you have provided during my internship!"}
