Only a quarter of them say they have savings goals or feel they are saving enough. Also, the <a href=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/pubs/bulletin/2012/PDF/scf12.pdf\">Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Consumer Finances for 2010</a> shows that the median net worth of Americans fell 39 percent, from $126,400 in 2007 to $77,300 in 2010. This represents a whopping loss of wealth and financial security for all Americans, and the data is even more daunting for low-income and minority communities.", "tag-1": "The Asset Building Policy Network: How can we support a savings culture?", "tag-2": "A recent Citi survey revealed that just 41 percent of people making less than $50,000 a year are saving on a regular basis.

ABPN members conduct research, develop policy and focus on building the capacity of their affiliate organizations. Several key priorities promote long-term economic security:", "tag-5": "Citi, the ABPN, and our partners are already at the forefront of driving these priorities. For example, in collaboration with nonprofits, municipalities and schools across the country, Citi's college savings programs couple simple, relevant financial products and services with financial education that is embedded in the school day. We are also working with National Council of La Raza, an APBN member also known as NCLR, to conduct research on the banking needs of low-income Hispanics and foreign-born individuals. Findings of this research are being debuted at the NCLR Lead the Way conference, which is going on now in Las Vegas. In addition, NCLR is also supporting our work with CASA de Maryland and other leading nonprofits in the Maryland and Washington, D.C. region to help legal permanent residents become naturalized U.S. citizens and establish new national and financial identities.", "tag-6": "This social media fueled Citizenship Maryland PSA debuted at the 2012 NCLR Lead the Way Conference.", "tag-7": "I am proud to be part of such powerful coalition and part of Citi's efforts to support a savings culture. I believe that, together, we will enable families to save and build assets for bright futures and strong communities.", "tag-8": "."}
