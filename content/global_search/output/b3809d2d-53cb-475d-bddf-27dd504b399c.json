The women, who are all Jordanian, have completed the initial phase of training at the AMIDEAST center in Amman and will continue to benefit from mentoring and other support as they seek to realize their potential as entrepreneurs over the coming months.", "tag-3": "During the initial 15-day training period, participants were introduced to the basic business skills required to succeed as an entrepreneur as well as the local requirements for registering and operating a business. Topics covered included how to write a business plan, develop a viable business strategy, carry out a feasibility study and navigate legal hurdles that may arise. Trainers also addressed personal development and management skills and covered the fundamentals of customer service, sales, small business accounting and branding.", "tag-4": "This intensive classroom activity was supplemented by implementing practical exercises to selected small businesses started and run by women and visits by guest speakers from the MicroFund for Women and the Development and Employment Fund, two Jordanian organizations dedicated to advancing economic empowerment in Jordan. Especially inspiring was a talk given by a female entrepreneur from a similar disadvantaged background who shared her story with the women.", "tag-5": "At the culmination of the initial training phase, each woman will develop a business plan. The AWEP model then provides for a follow-up period lasting nine months, during which participants will have opportunities for mentoring and periodic sessions with AMIDEAST trainers and Citi employees.", "tag-6": "Jordan is one of six countries where AMIDEAST has introduced AWEP, an initiative that it developed in order to extend its general entrepreneurship training programs to the specific needs of the region's women. Although women represent over half the region's population, they are noticeably absent from its entrepreneurial ranks and represent only 28 percent of its workforce. For the target group served by AWEP \u2014 women who possess a strong interest in owning a business but lack the resources to start one or are struggling to keep a small business afloat \u2014 the goal is even more elusive. Participant Maisa Abu Sbairat said, \"I have learnt so much from this training, I can't wait to go back to my small business and start implementing what I learned. I am not going to keep this knowledge to myself, but will also transfer the knowledge to the cooperative in which I volunteer.\"", "tag-7": "\"AWEP is Citi's first truly regional training project targeting local women entrepreneurs,\" said Mayank Malik, Chief Executive Officer for Citibank NA Jordan & Iraq. \"Our strategic alliance with AMIDEAST ensures that aspiring entrepreneurs in Jordan will have the chance to lead successful businesses and contribute to job creation in their markets. It also complements our efforts in this domain across various individual markets in the Middle East and North Africa.\"", "tag-8": "AMIDEAST/Jordan Country Director Dana Shuqom said, \"We salute Citi Foundation for its commitment to supporting entrepreneurs in the region and in Jordan, in particular. We value our partnership, which has allowed us to bring AMIDEAST's experience of over 50 years in empowering youth and women to supporting the aspirations of these entrepreneurial women.\"", "tag-9": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
