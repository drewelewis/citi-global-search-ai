The number of such points in the Czech Republic is rapidly growing, as is the proportion of contactless payments.", "tag-5": "\"In compliance with Visa Europe's long-term strategy, we are focused on progressive replacement of cash transactions with contactless ones. These represent faster, more secure and convenient form of payment via contactless technology (contactless cards, NFC smart phones and, most recently, payment stickers). As a result of our long-term cooperation with our member banks, there are more than 30,000 payment terminals supporting the contactless technology available to Visa products' holders in the Czech Republic,\" said Marcel Gajdo\u0161, Visa Europe Regional Manager for the Czech Republic and Slovakia.", "tag-6": "Visa Micro Tag contactless payment stickers are automatically issued free of charge with all new Citi O2 credit cards.
