This is where the Citi Elephant Nursery project can help. Commenting on the upcoming Citi Elephant Nursery, Director of Elephants at the Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation (GTAEF) said: \"The sad reality of elephants today is that they are used for begging and are often not well-fed and taken care of. The realization that an alternative could be offered to mahouts, their families, and these elephants is what led to the development of the Anantara Elephant Camp. We are proud and thankful to be taking this one step further by working with Citi to build the world's first hybrid elephant nursery area, combining traditional and modern expertise and allowing current and future baby elephants to be raised and trained in a friendly and conducive environment.\" Reaching further out to the local community, Citi Thailand invited students from a local school in Chiang Rai to visit the Anantara Elephant Camp and learn more about the elephants' life and the importance of these animals to Thailand's history and heritage. We will also engage with clients to be a part of the upcoming Citi Elephant Nursery. We will encourage our customers and credit card members to take part in this good cause through various marketing efforts, including rewards points donations to raise funds for the upcoming shelter and the various studies that will be conducted in the new facility. We hope that some of the best practices developed at the nursery will be useful for public sharing and educational purposes both here in Thailand, and in other parts of Asia where elephants face similar issues."}
