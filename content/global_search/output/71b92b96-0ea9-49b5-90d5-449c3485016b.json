The company hired about 150 veterans this year and expects to hire as many as 500 more in Operations & Technology alone over the next 12 months. Our employees are also offering professional development and mentoring to former service personnel as part of a Wall Street-wide effort, Veterans on Wall Street, to recruit veterans into the financial services sector.", "tag-4": "In recognition of the need to devote more time and resources to helping this group, Citi recently announced that Christopher Page--currently a Vice President in Control & Emerging Risk--is taking on a new role, focused solely on developing, coordinating and supporting all of Citi's products, programs and activities that serve military personnel and veterans. Page is a veteran of the U.S. Army and has served in the 18th Airborne Corps Artillery in Ft. Bragg, North Carolina and in Germany. He is currently a sergeant in the U.S. Army Reserve. Leading the Citi Veterans Initiative, Page will oversee our Disabled Veterans Mortgage Relief Program, the North America Service Initiative and the Citi Military Network.", "tag-5": "In addition, Richard D. Parsons, Citi's Chairman and a veteran himself, has been asked by First Lady Michelle Obama and Dr. Jill Biden to serve on the advisory board of Joining Forces, a national initiative that mobilizes all sectors of society to support our service members and their families.", "tag-6": "Page and Parsons will stand on the shoulders of Suni Harford, head of North American Markets in Citi's Institutional Clients Group, who spearheaded our efforts to assist veterans on a volunteer basis, and those of many other employees who have been working on this initiative over the past few years. With these additional resources, Citi can do even greater things for the veteran community."}
