But in fact, assets in college-savings plans increased 25% in 2012 to more than $166 billion, according to Morningstar, Inc.", "tag-1": "Three Reasons to Give 529 Plans a Second Look", "tag-2": "After the 2007-2009 stock-market plunge wreaked havoc with the performance of some 529 college-savings plans, there were fears that parents would take their education savings and go elsewhere. But in fact, assets in college-savings plans increased 25% in 2012 to more than $166 billion, according to Morningstar, Inc.", "tag-3": "This comeback isn't entirely surprising, given the stock-market rebound since early 2009. But even without strong market performance, 529 college-savings plans remain an intriguing choice--for three reasons.", "tag-4": "First, 529s offer significant tax benefits. While contributions to 529 plans aren't tax-deductible on your federal return, the money grows tax-deferred and withdrawals are tax-free as long as they're used for qualified education expenses. You may also get a state-tax deduction, but to qualify you will likely have to fund an in-state 529 plan.", "tag-5": "Second, you can invest substantial sums, no matter what your income. In 2013, single individuals can contribute up to $14,000 to a 529 plan without worrying about the gift tax, or a lump sum of $70,000 in the first year of a five-year period. During the following four years, no additional contributions can be made. Married couples can contribute up to $28,000 this year, or $140,000 if they're counting it as their gift for the next five years. Keep in mind that if you die before the end of this five-year period, a pro-rated share of your gift will be added back to your estate.", "tag-6": "Third, 529 plans are typically considered the parents' asset for purposes of determining financial aid. That means that, unlike money held in a child's name, 529 plan assets may have a relatively limited impact on aid eligibility.", "tag-7": "INVESTMENT PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022 NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-8": "Source: Asset growth quoted in April 22, 2013, press release from Morningstar, Inc.", "tag-9": "The tax law is complicated and subject to change in the future.
