It also includes a multi-page document, which would be available online, that defines the credit card terms used in the two-page prototype.", "tag-4": "The prototype form presents the credit card product terms in three sections: Costs, Changes and Additional Information. The Costs section, located at the top of the form, explains charges, interest rates, and related fees. The Changes section describes types of events that could trigger changes to the agreement. The Additional Information section contains the cardholder and card issuer rights, information on how billing and other disputes are handled, and a description of consumer privacy rights.", "tag-5": "In addition to the CFPB's efforts, several consumer advocacy organizations have long called for simplified disclosures designed to assist consumers in making informed decisions about which financial products and services are right for them. The Pew Charitable Trusts has developed prototypes of consumer-friendly checking account disclosures and is now recommending that financial services providers adopt a similar layout to clarify terms in a format that is easy to read and understand. Such disclosures are intended to make it possible for consumers to compare offers and select the product that best fits their needs.", "tag-6": "Citi has long supported efforts to simplify and standardize disclosures on a host of financial products and services, and we have endeavored to make our own disclosures as easy as possible for customers to understand. We believe that this allows consumers to look across the multiple products and services available to them from various financial services providers and helps them make informed decisions about which ones best fit their needs and budgets.", "tag-7": "We encourage you to provide your comments and feedback to the CFPB on its proposed model credit card disclosure at https://www.consumerfinance.gov/credit-cards/knowbeforeyouowe/, as well as its proposed mortgage and student lending disclosures.", "tag-8": "What do you think about the CFPB's credit card agreement prototype? What do you think of Pew's proposed checking account disclosures?
