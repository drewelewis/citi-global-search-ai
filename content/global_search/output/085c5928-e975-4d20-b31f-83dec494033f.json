The Subchapter S Corporation, named after a section of the tax code, is designed for smaller companies that need liability protection. It offers tax advantages not enjoyed by LLCs.", "tag-4": "An S-Corp, however, is limited to no more than 100 shareholders and involves more onerous initial and ongoing legal requirements. The IRS refers to the S-Corp as a \"pass-through\" entity in which all profits and losses pass through to the owners, who report this information on their personal tax returns. This can be a plus for new businesses, since they often lose money in the early years and you can offset those losses against personal income.", "tag-5": "The LLC, or limited liability company, is also a pass-through entity in which profits and losses flow through to the individual investors, who are called members. Like the S-Corp, members of an LLC typically aren't personally liable for its debts or other obligations. But unlike the S-Corp, there is no limit to the number of members. Which is right for you, an LLC or S-Corp? Before choosing, consider consulting an attorney with experience in this area.", "tag-6": "INVESTMENT AND INSURANCE PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022 NOT A BANK DEPOSIT \u2022 NOT INSURED BY ANY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY \u2022 NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-7": "Citigroup, Inc. and its affiliates do not provide tax or legal advice.
