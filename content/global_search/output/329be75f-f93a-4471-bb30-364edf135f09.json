At that time, Citi's payment holiday was extended to targeted areas hardest hit by Typhoon Ondoy. The second time was last year following the extensive flooding brought about by the southwest monsoon.", "tag-8": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
