But for taxpayers in a third of all states, including some of the most populous, it's the \"death tax\" imposed by their state government that can prove more costly.", "tag-1": "Estate Taxes: How Hard Does Your State Hit?", "tag-2": "The federal-estate tax gets all the attention, with politicians often debating its size and merits. But for taxpayers in a third of all states, including some of the most populous, it's the \"death tax\" imposed by their state government that can prove more costly.", "tag-3": "To complicate matters, some states impose an inheritance tax, rather than the more common estate tax. The estate tax is calculated on the net worth of a deceased person's entire property, minus the exemption. The less common inheritance tax is levied on the assets a beneficiary receives.", "tag-4": "The 2012 federal estate-tax exemption for single individuals is $5.12 million, while for married couples it's $10.24 million. But in states that have an estate tax, the exemptions are usually lower, which means that families that avoid federal estate taxes may still get hit at the state level. For example, the exemption is $1 million in New York and $3.5 million in Illinois. Of the 18 states with an estate tax, only Delaware and North Carolina match the federal exemption.", "tag-5": "Moreover, state law isn't always straightforward. Take Pennsylvania. It doesn't have an estate or inheritance tax for spouses, but children and grandchildren face a 4.5% inheritance tax, while the tax increases to 12% for siblings and 15% for anyone else. Maryland and New Jersey, meanwhile, have both inheritance and estate taxes.", "tag-6": "If you want to retire to a state that doesn't have an estate or inheritance tax, you must take specific steps to \"disestablish\" residency in your previous state, especially if you plan to use your old house as a second home. Some states conduct residency audits to determine how many days you spent there.", "tag-7": "Keep in mind that, even if a state doesn't have an estate tax, it might have high income or property tax rates instead, so changing states may not necessarily leave you better off financially. The bottom line: Before moving, consider consulting a tax expert or attorney to help you navigate the tax issues and residency requirements involved.", "tag-8": "For more from Jonathan Clements, click here.", "tag-9": "INVESTMENT AND INSURANCE PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED \u2022 NOT A BANK DEPOSIT \u2022 NOT INSURED BY ANY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY \u2022 NO BANK GUARANTEE \u2022 MAY LOSE VALUE", "tag-10": "Citigroup Inc. and its affiliates do not provide tax or legal advice.
