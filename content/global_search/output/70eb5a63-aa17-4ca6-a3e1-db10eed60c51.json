We are on track to achieve that $100 Billion Environmental Finance Goal \u2013 as of 2017, we had financed or facilitated $57 billion towards environmental finance activities, and our progress in 2018 will be reported in our upcoming annual report and global citizenship report. We also recently announced a new commitment to source renewable power for 100% of our company's global energy needs by 2020. Both initiatives are part of Citi's Sustainable Progress Strategy, which sets out our guiding principles, priorities and ambitions in environmental finance and environmental and social risk management, including our own operations and supply chain. It also forms part of our contribution to advancing the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).", "tag-4": "The second-party opinion provider, Sustainalytics, has reviewed our Green Bond Framework and has confirmed in a Second Party Opinion that it is aligned with Citi's broader sustainability objectives as well as with the Green Bond Principles.
