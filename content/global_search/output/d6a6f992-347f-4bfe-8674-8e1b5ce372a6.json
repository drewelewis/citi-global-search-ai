Our most recent example of this innovative spirit is Citibank Express - a \"Smart Banking\" machine that allows customers to do almost all of their banking without visiting a branch, including opening accounts and applying for loans, cards and cashier's checks. The first Citibank Express machines were unveiled last week at Citibank branches in Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines.", "tag-1": "New Smart Banking ATM Citibank Express Creates Next-Gen Customer Experience", "tag-2": "Since Citi's founding in 1812, we have applied our passion for innovation to connect clients to the world.

A customer can start a transaction on a computer or mobile device and complete it on Citibank Express--and vice versa. Citibank Express's \"split screen\" makes navigation intuitive. The screen can display personalized promotions and offers, and allows clients to see and speak with a customer service representative on one screen while conducting business on the other. The machines have near field communication capabilities as well as scanning and embossing functions to allow for future roll-outs of functions such as instant printing of credit and ATM cards.", "tag-4": "Citibank Express marks the first major redesign of the ATM since Citibank introduced unattended branches in the 1970s. The concept grew out of the award-winning Smart Banking project Citi started in 2008 with extensive research into consumer needs and behavior. Our leadership in Asia collaborated with Citi's innovation team, Citi Ventures. Citi launched Smart Banking in Japan in 2010, and Citi now has more than 100 Smart Banking branches across Asia.", "tag-5": "The ability to rapidly set up the machines and to add features as we develop them is a key characteristic of Citibank Express. We don't expect it to replace branches, but it will simplify our customers' lives, generate new value for Citi, and help transform the financial services industry. Citi plans to add in-branch and out-of-branch locations across Asia and globally later this year.", "tag-6": "Citibank Express is a big step towards our goal to be the world's digital bank and we believe it can significantly impact the way people bank across the globe."}
