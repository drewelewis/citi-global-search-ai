Knowing that our colleagues, clients and communities were hurt by this comment deeply saddens us. We condemn antisemitism, Islamophobia and all hate speech. We do not tolerate it at our bank in any form, and act quickly when we see it.", "tag-5": "What we witnessed last week was in stark contrast to the inclusive and respectful environment embraced by the vast majority of our colleagues. Every day, we see examples of how genuine concern for one another\u2019s wellbeing and the respect we have for differing points of view guide interactions among our colleagues.", "tag-6": "We don\u2019t need a policy to tell us what\u2019s right and how we should treat one another. That being said, the standards of behavior we expect from our colleagues are clearly laid out in our Code of Conduct, Anti-Discrimination and Anti-Harassment Policy and Social Media Standard. We encourage you to review these. We will take decisive action to ensure that our bank and our people are appropriately protected from acts and words by Citi employees that violate those standards, whether made in or outside of the workplace, including on social media.", "tag-7": "At the core of our deepest pride in Citi is our bank\u2019s diversity and the many ways our colleagues regularly support, encourage and show compassion to one other. Thank you for helping us maintain this true source of strength."}
