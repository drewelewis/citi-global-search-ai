Third quarter 2013 results also included a $176 million tax benefit related to the resolution of certain tax audit items, compared to a $582 million tax benefit in the prior year period (both recorded within Corporate/Other). In addition, third quarter 2012 results included a pre-tax loss of $4.7 billion ($2.9 billion after-tax) related to the Morgan Stanley Smith Barney joint venture (MSSB).5 Excluding CVA/DVA in both periods and the MSSB loss in the third quarter 2012, third quarter 2013 revenues were $18.2 billion, down 5% from the prior year period.

While many of the factors which influence our revenues are not within our full control, we certainly can control our costs, and I am pleased with our expense discipline and improved efficiency year-to-date.", "tag-6": "\"We also continued to reduce the size of Citi Holdings, now 6% of our balance sheet, and its drag on our earnings during the quarter. We generated additional capital, primarily through retained earnings and DTA utilization, and our Tier 1 Common ratio increased to an estimated 10.4% on a Basel III basis. Other key capital metrics also strengthened, including our Supplementary Leverage Ratio, which increased to an estimated 5.1%.

Excluding CVA/DVA and the third quarter 2012 MSSB loss, Citi Holdings revenues increased 28% versus the prior year period, mainly driven by the absence of repurchase reserve builds for representations and warranty claims in the third quarter 2013. Total Citi Holdings assets of $122 billion declined $49 billion, or 29%, from the third quarter 2012. Citi Holdings assets at the end of the third quarter 2013 represented approximately 6% of total Citigroup assets.", "tag-10": "Citigroup's net income increased to $3.2 billion in the third quarter 2013 from $468 million in the prior year period. Excluding CVA/DVA and the tax benefit in both periods, as well as the third quarter 2012 MSSB loss, Citigroup net income of $3.3 billion was roughly flat compared to the prior year period, as lower operating expenses and lower credit costs were offset by the decline in revenues and a higher tax rate. Operating expenses of $11.7 billion were 4% lower than the prior year period. Citigroup's cost of credit in the third quarter 2013 was $2.0 billion, 25% below the prior year period, reflecting a $1.5 billion improvement in net credit losses partially offset by a $827 million decline in net loan loss reserve releases.

Total credit costs increased 14% compared to the prior period, driven by lower loan loss reserve releases in the North America cards business and reserve builds in international GCB, which were partially offset by lower net credit losses.", "tag-21": "North America GCB revenues declined 12% to $4.7 billion versus the prior year period driven mainly by the lower retail banking revenues, with total cards revenues (Citi-branded cards and Citi retail services) remaining roughly flat. Retail banking revenues declined 35% to $1.1 billion from the third quarter 2012, primarily reflecting lower mortgage origination revenues as well as the impact of ongoing spread compression, partially offset by 8% deposit growth and 15% growth in commercial loans. Retail banking revenues are expected to continue to be negatively impacted by lower mortgage origination revenues and spread compression. Citi-branded cards revenues remained flat at $2.1 billion, reflecting a 4% decline in average loans offset by a continued improvement in net interest spreads. Citi retail services revenues declined 1% to $1.5 billion, primarily reflecting higher contractual partner share payments due to the continued impact of improving credit trends.", "tag-22": "North America GCB net income was $932 million, 27% lower than the third quarter 2012.

Operating expenses in the third quarter 2013 declined 4% (declined 1% on a constant dollar basis) to $2.7 billion as repositioning actions more than offset volume growth. Credit costs increased 29% (34% in constant dollars) versus the prior year period, driven by increases in Latin America GCB reflecting portfolio growth and seasoning as well as specific loan loss reserve builds in Mexico related to Citi's exposure to homebuilders as well as the impact of potential losses related to the recent hurricanes in the region.", "tag-26": "International GCB credit quality remained relatively stable.
