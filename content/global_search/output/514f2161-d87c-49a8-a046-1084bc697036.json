We started small, opening North Star Academy Charter School with 72 fifth-grade students in Newark in 1997. Two years later, Roxbury Preparatory Charter School in Boston welcomed its first class of sixth-graders. This fall, nearly 10,000 students entered our classrooms in our 38 schools across five cities: Boston, Newark, New York City, Rochester, and Troy.

We felt grateful to be honored for this hard work this summer when we received the 2013 Broad Prize for Public Charter Schools, which recognizes \"the public charter management organization that has demonstrated the most outstanding overall student performance and improvement in the nation in recent years while reducing achievement gaps for low-income students and students of color.\" <br><br>Just as importantly, Uncommon is demonstrating the financial viability of our efforts.

As a result of this disciplined financial management, we are able to leverage and target our philanthropic dollars strategically.
