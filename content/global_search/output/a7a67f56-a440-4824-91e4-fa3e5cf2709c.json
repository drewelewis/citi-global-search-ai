Although tourism is on the rebound, it is growing increasingly competitive and hotels are finding it harder to create unique selling points to attract visitors. This is especially true for small hotels.\"", "tag-4": "Small hotels often lack the expertise and resources to learn about and deploy innovative and leading-edge technologies to promote sustainable business practices. \"The lack of good eco-efficiency and corporate social responsibility in the hospitality sector has significant costs for businesses and contributes to excessive waste and the emission of greenhouse gases. Ultimately, this will drive away the very customers the tourism industry needs to grow,\" according to Peter.", "tag-5": "As a leading organization committed to economic empowerment and environmental sustainability, Citi has teamed up with the Kenan Institute Asia to initiate the \"Citi - Triple Bottom Line Small Hotels Pilot Project.\" The goal of this project is to build the capacity of 60 small hotel managers and owners in the central region of Thailand to operate in a sustainable manner by utilizing a triple bottom-line business strategy. This will be achieved by training small hotel owners and managers in the three components of triple bottom line, People-Planet-Profit, through a series of workshops and one-on-one counseling. The training is provided at no cost to the hotels, and each trainee will receive a copy of the United Nations Environmental Programme's (UNEP) interactive CD-ROM 'Envirotel,' which guides users through an easy to understand process for achieving environmental savings in their operations.", "tag-6": "Peter further added that, \"The triple bottom-line principle for SMEs is an exciting new focus area of the Citi Foundation, and we are pleased that Thailand is one of the first countries that will benefit from this programming.\"", "tag-7": "The workshop features key activities such as a seminar on corporate social responsibility and sustainable resource management, including the use of the Envirotel e-Tool. Participants will be equipped with tricks of the trade to create innovations for sustainable growth and receive one-on-one advice from local and foreign experts throughout the project, which will end in September 2011. Ten hotel participants will also be selected to serve as case studies for a publication to assist other hotel operators and entrepreneurs seeking to leverage the potential of sustainable business management using the triple bottom-line strategy.", "tag-8": "Citi Citi, the leading global financial services company, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
