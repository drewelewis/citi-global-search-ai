Second quarter 2012 results included a loss of $424 million ($274 million after-tax) related to the sale of a 10.1% stake in Akbank T.A.S.

We also continued to make progress in several critical areas. We reduced the earnings drag caused by Citi Holdings, where we saw the largest percentage reduction of assets since 2010. We again consumed a modest amount of DTA, bringing the total utilized to about $1.3 billion for the first half of the year.

The increase reflected revenue growth and lower net credit losses, partially offset by higher legal and related expenses, a lower loan loss reserve release and a higher effective tax rate.

Citi's effective tax rate in the second quarter 2013 was 34%, compared to 19% in the prior year period.
