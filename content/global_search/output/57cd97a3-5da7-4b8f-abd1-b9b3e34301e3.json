However, there are several \"saving graces\" for emerging market equities.", "tag-3": "They have been outperforming since mid-year, unusually in falling markets. Investors may finally be rewarding--in relative terms--emerging markets for their better fundamentals compared to developed markets. For example, Citi economists forecast an average 2011 budget deficit in the 20 countries in the benchmark global emerging markets index of 2.2% of gross domestic product (GDP), while the average for a broad group of developed economies is 6.5% of GDP.", "tag-4": "There are fears that downgrades to real growth in the U.S. and other developed markets will fuel downgrades in emerging markets. While Citi cut its Indian GDP forecast for FY12 to 7.6% from 8.1% recently, the growth outlook in many emerging markets remains very robust and should support the asset class as well as the world economy as a whole. We continue to expect China to grow at 9.2% in 2011 and 9% in 2012, with clear signs now that a slowdown earlier in 2011 has ended. Nominal GDP growth (real GDP growth plus inflation) also remains high in emerging markets at an estimated 12.8% in 2011 and 12% in 2012 compared to the developed markets equivalent forecasts of 4.3% (2011) and 4% (2012).", "tag-5": "The main source of the current growth worries around the world is the U.S., but many emerging markets face a narrow U.S. exposure. Mexico's is by far the highest, with 23% of the country's GDP being accounted for by exports to the U.S. The next most exposed are Malaysia (10.2%), Taiwan (7.3%), and Thailand (6.3%). Just 4.5% of Asian GDP is accounted for by exports to the U.S., while EMEA is the most sheltered with a ratio of 1.2%. None of the BRICs have particularly high ratios of exports to the U.S. relative to their GDP. China's ratio is at 4.9%, while those of Russia, India and, especially Brazil, are below 2% of GDP. With intra-regional trade growing across the emerging markets universe, especially in Asia, the effect of negative growth surprises in the U.S. may be less than feared and certainly less than in the past.", "tag-6": "In other bullish signs, with emerging market equities dropping to the bottom of their recent trading range, valuations have fallen, with the forward P/E ratio now down to 10.2x, a discount of 12% to its recent history. This trend, along with falling average debt yields, has caused the gap between the trailing earnings yield (now at 8.2%) and the average debt yield (4.06%) to widen even more, showing how very attractively valued emerging market equities have become relative to emerging market debt.", "tag-7": "The market panic seems overdone. The risk of U.S. recession remains low and global growth should remain solid, especially in emerging markets. With the approach of the peak in inflation and interest rates in key emerging markets, we expect a rebound from the current sell-off and a return to solid gains over the rest of this year.", "tag-8": "NOTE: This post is adapted from a Citi Global Emerging Markets Strategy note entitled \"Saving Graces,\" published on Aug, 4, 2011."}
