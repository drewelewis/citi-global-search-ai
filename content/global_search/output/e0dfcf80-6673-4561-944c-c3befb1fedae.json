Variables including policy changes, budget cuts, and local crises constantly impact how (and how <em>well</em>) community-based organizations can respond. While we need all the help we can get, some philanthropic support can be prescriptive and overly restrictive about our approach and how we define success. To truly accelerate progress, nonprofits need support in a form that encourages us to adapt to external shifts and develop new ways of addressing long-standing issues. The Citi Foundation's Community Progress Makers Fund helped us do just that.

While universities typically frame economic prosperity around degree attainment, the flexibility offered by the Community Progress Makers Fund allowed us to respond to our community's needs differently. Now we also look at our role in providing access to resources and direct services. As a Community Progress Maker, StartUP FIU FOOD is leveraging multiple university resources to anchor our support for community members we didn't traditionally serve.Green City ForceNew York City", "tag-6": "Being chosen as a Community Progress Maker among leaders from around the country was a great honor. Thanks to the care and thought that defines this innovative, program, we've learned a great deal from our peers working in related and overlapping fields as well as from the Citi Foundation team. It's been invaluable to have a way of understanding our work in a broader context and to be exposed to cutting-edge practices that can help to inform our work. The significant unrestricted funds\u2014so rare and so important for an organization like ours\u2014have provided the platform we needed to undertake new innovation and growth. Pro bono skills-based workshops led by Citi volunteers helped strengthen our communications strategy and story-telling. The program's full-on support and conditioning have truly positioned us for much greater impact in the future.", "tag-7": "Mission Economic Development Agency (MEDA)San Francisco", "tag-8": "Due to the tech boom's gentrification of San Francisco's Mission District, MEDA was compelled to expand its r\u00e9sum\u00e9 to include \"Community Real Estate\" as a means of reversing the current trend of displacing established family-serving businesses and low-income immigrant Latinos who for decades have called the neighborhood home. Thanks to the invaluable support of the Community Progress Makers Fund, MEDA was able to take the risk of creating the Adelante Fund, a community loan arm that helps finance small businesses unable to access capital from traditional lenders. The Fund has also helped to preserve and produce 1,026 affordable housing units. MEDA has now doubled its Community Real Estate goal from producing 1,000 affordable housing units to 2,000 units by 2020, as we achieved our initial goal three years ahead of schedule.", "tag-9": "To learn more about the Community Progress Makers Fund, visit citifoundation.com and follow #ProgressMakers in social media."}
