I am urging all residents who qualify to please take advantage of these programs.\"", "tag-9": "About the Earned Income Tax Credit The EITC enables working people who earn approximately $50,000 or less per year to keep more of their earnings through a tax refund. The IRS estimates that four out of five eligible people claim and receive the EITC. However, many people, including millions of eligible workers who qualified for the EITC for the first time in 2013, may not know about the credit or that they must file an income tax return in order to claim the benefit. To sign-up for the program, visit http://1.usa.gov/1bXXK2Z.", "tag-10": "About the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) program The VITA program generally offers free tax help to people who make $51,000 or less and need assistance in preparing their own tax returns. IRS-certified volunteers provide free basic income tax return preparation with electronic filing to qualified individuals in local communities, and can inform taxpayers about special tax credits for which they may qualify, including the EITC. VITA sites are generally located at community and neighborhood centers, libraries, schools, shopping malls, and other convenient locations.
