We generated revenue growth and had positive operating leverage across all three of Citi's core businesses. Global Consumer Banking, our largest business, produced another quarter of good growth in revenues, net income and key drivers like loans and deposits. Transaction Services had record quarterly revenues as it captured increasing share in global trade finance, and Securities and Banking rebounded strongly with year-over-year revenue growth excluding the impact of CVA/DVA.", "tag-6": "\"We continued to wind down our Citi Holdings legacy portfolio, which now stands at 11% of our total assets, while further building capital.

Excluding CVA/DVA, Citicorp revenues were $19.4 billion, 6% higher than the first quarter 2011. The increase reflected revenue growth in Citicorp's three businesses with Global Consumer Banking (GCB) revenues 5% higher, Securities and Banking (excluding CVA/DVA) 6% higher and Transaction Services revenues 7% higher versus first quarter 2011.", "tag-11": "Citi Holdings revenues of $874 million in the first quarter 2012 were 47% below the prior year period. Excluding CVA/DVA, Citi Holdings revenues were $786 million, 53% lower than the first quarter 2011. Negative revenues in the Special Asset Pool and Brokerage and Asset Management and lower revenues in Local Consumer Lending drove the decline in Citi Holdings revenues. The lower revenues also reflected the ongoing decline in assets in Citi Holdings. Total Citi Holdings assets declined $86 billion, or 29%, from the first quarter 2011, to $209 billion. Citi Holdings assets at the end of the first quarter 2012 represented approximately 11% of total Citigroup assets.", "tag-12": "Citigroup's net income declined 2% from the first quarter 2011 to $2.9 billion.

Operating expenses of $12.3 billion were essentially unchanged from the prior year period. Citigroup's cost of credit in the first quarter 2012 was 5% below the prior year period, as a $2.3 billion improvement in net credit losses was largely offset by a $2.2 billion reduction in net loan loss reserve releases.", "tag-13": "Citigroup's total allowance for loan losses was $29.0 billion at quarter end, or 4.5% of total loans, compared to $36.6 billion, or 5.8%, in the prior year period.

Credit reserve releases in Citicorp of $588 million and in Citi Holdings of $576 million were 67% and 63% lower, respectively, than the first quarter 2011. Citicorp's decline in credit reserve releases reflected lower releases in North America GCB and a net credit reserve build primarily in international GCB (Asia, Latin America and EMEA) and Securities and Banking. The decline in Citi Holdings credit reserve releases was almost entirely due to the Special Asset Pool, where credit reserve releases were $55 million in the first quarter 2012, compared to $980 million in the first quarter 2011. Citigroup asset quality continued to improve as total non-accrual assets fell 25% to $12.3 billion compared to the first quarter 2011. Corporate non-accrual loans fell 46% to $3.0 billion and consumer non-accrual loans fell 6% to $8.7 billion.

Transaction Services revenues grew 7% to $2.7 billion.", "tag-16": "Citicorp net income decreased 3% from the prior year period to $4.3 billion. The decrease largely reflects the 1% decline in reported revenues, primarily stemming from the impact of CVA/DVA in Securities and Banking, and higher credit costs due primarily to lower loan loss reserve releases.

The increase largely reflects significantly lower credit reserve releases, which declined 67% to $588 million, partially offset by lower net credit losses, which at $2.2 billion were 32% lower than the first quarter 2011. The decline in net credit reserve releases was largely in GCB.

Retail banking revenues grew 37% to $1.6 billion from the first quarter 2011 largely due to improved results in mortgages. Citi-branded cards revenues declined 6% to $2.1 billion, and Citi retail services revenues declined 3% to $1.5 billion, both versus the prior year period. The lower results in cards primarily reflected lower average loan balances for both businesses as Citi-branded cards loans declined 2% and Citi retail services loans declined 5% from first quarter 2011, as well as lower yields in Citi-branded cards.", "tag-22": "North America GCB net income was $1.3 billion, 41% higher than the first quarter 2011.

Latin America and Asia saw continued year-over-year growth in average loans and average deposits during the first quarter 2012.", "tag-25": "International GCB net income fell 12% from the prior year period to $870 million primarily due to a net credit reserve build of $106 million in the first quarter 2012 compared to a net release of $216 million in the prior year period. While operating expenses in the first quarter 2012 grew 2% from the first quarter 2011 to $2.9 billion, international GCB achieved year-over-year positive operating leverage for the second consecutive quarter as year-over-year revenue growth outpaced expense growth.", "tag-26": "International GCB credit quality improved modestly from the prior year period as net credit losses fell 3% to $649 million.

Fixed Income results primarily reflected strong performance in rates and currencies across all products and regions, as overall market conditions improved in the first quarter 2012 and client activity increased. Credit and securitized products were down versus the prior year period, largely reflecting lower risk levels in the business.", "tag-29": "Equity Markets revenues of $902 million in the first quarter 2012 (excluding a negative $283 million of CVA/DVA) were 18% below the prior year period. The decline was largely related to lower industry volumes, particularly in cash equities.", "tag-30": "Investment Banking revenues grew 2% from the prior year period to $865 million as growth in debt underwriting offset declines in advisory and equity underwriting revenues.

Citi Holdings assets represented 11% of total Citigroup assets at the end of the first quarter.

Local Consumer Lending revenues of $1.3 billion fell 13% from the prior year period primarily due to the 24% decline in average loans. Special Asset Pool revenues were a negative $406 million versus a negative $7 million in the prior year period largely reflecting the 51% year-over-year decline in assets, the absence of positive private equity marks recorded in the prior year period and a reserve build related to private-label mortgage securitizations in the first quarter 2012.

Credit improved in Local Consumer Lending with net credit losses declining 25% from the prior year period to $1.8 billion, partially offset by a 6% decrease in the credit reserve release to $520 million. The improvement in net credit losses was reflected across the international and North America portfolios in Local Consumer Lending.
