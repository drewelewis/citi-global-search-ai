We're proud that this commitment to diversity and inclusion as an integral part of everyday business practice has been recognized by the Human Rights Campaign, which has awarded Citi a 100% rating in its Corporate Equality Index every year since 2004.", "tag-4": "Panel speakers anecdotally relayed stories of Citi's commitment to providing a safe space for those employees who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender. Wes Walraven, Co-Head, Global Industrials Group, Investment Banking, shared that in all his years as an investment banker with Citi, he has never tried to hide his sexuality as a gay man, and that it has been a nonissue for his colleagues and the company. \"My partner has always been a part of my benefits plan and the firm helped us with our relocation back to New York from the West Coast,\" he said.", "tag-5": "When asked at the end of the discussion what she wanted the biggest take away from the event to be, Lisa Davis, Co-Chair of the Citi Pride Network NYC and Global Transaction Services Project Manager, stated, \"My hope is that the students walk away understanding the importance of a company's commitment to diversity, not just from a business profitability perspective, but just as a good business practice, [and that] whatever my affinity is, it will be important to the firm.\"", "tag-6": "Kartik Arora, a Citi summer intern, shared his thoughts on Citi hosting such an event. \"It's great to have allies. If I'm here 12 hours a day, I want to be able to be comfortable with who I am and know that the company I work for is comfortable with that as well,\" Arora said. Meikel Mokry, another Citi summer intern, genuinely enjoyed the panel discussion, saying, \"I like that Citi is making a united effort to create a supportive environment. I consider myself an ally and I definitely see building an ally-base as a positive for the firm. It will make Citi an even better place, employees more comfortable and ultimately result in a more efficient work environment.\"", "tag-7": "Nasser Malik, Managing Director, Structured Finance, summed up the evening's sentiment best when he said, \"I've been with Citi for 24 years and it's been a fantastic 24 years. Being LGBT in the workplace has been very much a non-event for me.\" Chad Leat, Global Banking Vice Chairman, echoed this thought with his statement, \"I don't think my sexuality has had any influence on my success. I can't think of a single time in almost 30 years where my sexuality has hindered my professional development.\""}
