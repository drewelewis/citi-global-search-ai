By straddling a cultural divide, we serve those who identify with two cultures. Over the past year, we have expanded our Banamex USA branch network in California, Texas and Arizona and have partnered with Citibank in Illinois, Texas and Missouri to expand financial inclusion in those states as well. We offer our customers professional and efficient solutions for their banking and financial needs, in a fully bilingual and bicultural manner. We have specific credit card programs geared to individuals who do not have established credit history in the United States, and we work to make these programs as easy-to-use and customer-friendly as possible.", "tag-6": "We will continue to pursue diversity in our business and in our communities.
