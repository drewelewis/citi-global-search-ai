But do all of these accounts, taken together, give you a sensible investment mix?", "tag-3": "A fistful of different accounts might offer the illusion that you've spread your investment dollars widely. But whether you are truly well diversified depends on what you own in each account and in what amounts. For instance, if all your accounts are heavily tilted toward U.S. large-company stocks, with scant exposure to bonds, U.S. small-cap stocks and foreign shares, you likely own a lopsided portfolio, no matter how many different accounts you have.", "tag-4": "What to do? You may want to coordinate the investments in your various accounts. That doesn't just have the potential to improve your portfolio's diversification.

In general, as prevailing interest rates rise, fixed income securities prices will fall. Bonds face credit risk if a decline in an issuer's credit rating, or creditworthiness, causes a bond's price to decline. High yield bonds are subject to additional risks such as increased risk of default and greater volatility because of the lower credit quality of the issues. Finally, bonds can be subject to prepayment risk. When interest rates fall, an issuer may choose to borrow money at a lower interest rate, while paying off its previously issued bonds. As a consequence, underlying bonds will lose the interest payments from the investment and will be forced to reinvest in a market where prevailing interest rates are lower than when the initial investment was made.", "tag-10": "\u00a92013 Citi Personal Wealth Management is a business of Citigroup Inc., which offers investment products through Citigroup Global Markets Inc.
