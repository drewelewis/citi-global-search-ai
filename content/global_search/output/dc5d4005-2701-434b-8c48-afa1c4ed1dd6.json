This is also confirmed by the latest data from Citibank Europe plc, which suggests that the number of foreign transactions through Citi credit cards almost doubled (up by 90 percent) in July 2013 compared to the average number of transactions executed through credit cards per month in the first half of this year. The overall volume of these transactions increased by more than one half (up by 55 percent). A similar trend was also visible in August this year. Citibank's share of Czech clients' foreign transactions executed through credit cards is about one fifth of the Czech market.

The volume of such transactions rises more slowly. Czechs also do not think twice about using credit cards for smaller payments, including those at supermarkets and restaurants or admission tickets for sightseeing tours,\" says Milan Rezn\u00edcek, Credit Card Manager at Citibank. The transactions on Citibank credit cards abroad average at CZK 2,136.", "tag-4": "The long grace period is an advantage When using their credit cards clients benefit from the long grace period, which is up to 55 days for Citi credit cards. This makes it possible for them to draw money from the bank within the defined credit limit and, subject to timely repayment of the whole outstanding amount during the grace period, even completely without interest. In addition, Citi credit cards support the use of attractive up-to-25-percent discounts under the City Club program at partners specializing in everything from gastronomy, shopping, sport and travel, to health and body care. The Hotel Privileges program provides Citibank clients with exclusive privileges in a number of hotels throughout the world.", "tag-5": "\"It is quite normal to pay by credit cards in other countries. There are moments when tourists cannot do without them, for example, when renting a car in many places. Credit cards inspire confidence because they imply that the cardholder is a creditworthy client well-tested by their bank,\" adds Milan Rezn\u00edcek.", "tag-6": "Because of the better rates of exchange, it is generally more advantageous to use credit cards for payments outside the Czech Republic than to exchange cash for holidays at bureau de change offices. At the same time, the risk of credit card holders losing their money due to card loss or theft is significantly reduced. Credit cards can also be immediately disabled from abroad, which prevents their potential abuse. You can also take out optional travel insurance on your credit card, and therefore do not have to take out one-off cover before you travel abroad; travel insurance on the card can already be arranged in the application for a credit card.", "tag-7": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
