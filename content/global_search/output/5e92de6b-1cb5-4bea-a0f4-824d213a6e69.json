In 1990, downturns in the U.S. real-estate market and in the Australian economy contributed to fresh write-offs. The bank instituted a five-point plan to restore earnings and rebuild its capital base. In 1991, Citibank suffered a run on deposits in Hong Kong, which had a long history of financial panics. With the collapse of the Bank of Credit and Commerce International fresh in the public mind, a panic was triggered by a U.S. congressman's careless remark that Citibank was \"insolvent.\"", "tag-6": "At the time, Jorge Bermudez was head of risk for international banking in New York. While New York considered shutting the Hong Kong operation down, \"the decision was taken to stay open and keep giving people their money back,\" Bermudez said. Corporate clients joined HSBC and Standard Chartered in providing liquidity to Citibank's local operation. \"We also flew some currency up from Australia to Hong Kong. We were able to maintain the flow and eventually people got tired of standing in line.\"", "tag-7": "When he was head of Citibank in Argentina in 1994, Bermudez gained first-hand experience of a bank run. It was triggered by Mexico's decision to devalue its currency, which prompted investors to start pulling money out of Latin America. The run was not against the bank itself, but against the entire financial system, and lasted three months, to mid-March. \"We had to go to our customers who had liquidity and say we needed them to pay their loans back because we needed the funds to pay depositors. Or we had to go to people we knew had liquidity and ask them to deposit funds with us,\" Bermudez said. \"I used to have daily meetings with the central bank president and the minister of the economy to ask what we should be doing.\"", "tag-8": "In the process, Citibank supported two other banks. Looking back, Bermudez highlighted the importance of building strong ties with government officials and regulators. \"By the time the crisis hits, if you haven't built those relationships, it's too late,\" he said. \"When I left Argentina in 1998, the president, the economy minister and the central bank president gave me a private farewell dinner at the president's home to thank me for what we achieved during that run. That time was very stressful but we did do some good for the country.\"", "tag-9": "Click here for more stories from Citi's history."}
