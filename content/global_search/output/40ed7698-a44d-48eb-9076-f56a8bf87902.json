There are over 500 million people in Asia with a net worth of US$10,000 to US$100,000 and the financial services revenues from this segment are expected to grow 8 percent to 15 percent per year in most countries2.", "tag-6": "Mr. Anil Wadhwani, CEO of Citibank Singapore Limited, said: \"As the wealth in Singapore and Asia grows, the lifestyles, needs and aspirations of the emerging affluent are changing. They want a banking partner that suits their fast-paced lifestyles, giving them the ability to bank when, where and how they want to. In response to this, Citibank is launching a powerful value proposition for the emerging-affluent segment in Asia.\"", "tag-7": "The new proposition is premised upon three pillars:", "tag-8": "Said Mr. Wadhwani: \"With the new Personal Banking proposition, we are strengthening and broadening our offering to the emerging-affluent segment, availing to them the banking services typically reserved for the affluent. This new proposition is an extension of Citibank's Smart Banking launch last year, which offers customers a unique digital experience and is supported by all the benefits that come from a global banking partner.\"", "tag-9": "The new value proposition was developed in response to customer feedback from an extensive survey of 8,000 emerging affluent individuals across six Asia Pacific markets.

Additionally, these clients are living increasingly global lifestyles and want a bank to support them with their international banking, traveling and investing needs. Our new value proposition seeks to deliver a distinctly higher level of service along all of these dimensions and asks clients to aspire to a higher standard and rethink the way they bank,\" said Mr. Daniel Baranowski, Head of the Emerging Affluent Segment for Citi in Asia Pacific.", "tag-11": "The launch of the new proposition comes as both the number of individuals and the wealth of the emerging affluent in Singapore grow. From 2007 to 2010, the estimated market size of those with AUM less than S$200,000 grew 14 percent. Within the same period, Citibank's total Personal Banking portfolio of customers grew at an average rate of more than 20 percent every year. The wealth of this segment has been growing steadily as well. Over the past three years, more than half of all new Citigold clients (with AUM of between S$200,000 and S$1 million) were upgraded from the Personal Banking base. From 2009 to 2010, the assets under management for this segment also grew 15 percent and are expected to continue growing at 15 percent a year for the next three years.", "tag-12": "The enhanced Personal Banking proposition is the latest part of Citibank's strategy to strengthen its offering to clients in every segment, giving them a customized proposition as they grow in wealth and in the sophistication of their financial needs \u2013 from the emerging affluent, to the affluent (Citigold), the high net worth individuals (Citigold Private Client) and the ultra high net worth individuals (Citi Private Bank).", "tag-13": "In the past year, Citibank Singapore has been enhancing its value propositions to its clients across the wealth continuum. In April 2010, the bank launched Citigold Private Client, a personalized wealth management proposition for high net worth individuals with S$1 million to US$10 million in AUM. This was followed in November with Citigold launching a new unique client servicing model, where relationship managers are closely matched to the needs and profiles of affluent clients owning between S$200,000 and S$1 million in investible assets.", "tag-14": "Increased convenience and responsiveness with new e-Chat service and enhanced CitiPhone promise", "tag-15": "In today's increasingly borderless and fast-paced world, being able to access account information and banking services immediately and conveniently is a top priority for banking customers.", "tag-16": "Ms. Jacquelyn Tan, Country Marketing Director at Citibank Singapore Limited said: \"Consumers today are embracing technology in every aspect of their lives, including for their banking needs.
