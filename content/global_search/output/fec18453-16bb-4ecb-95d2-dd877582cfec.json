These include: Capital goods investment - In just the past two years, there has been a jump in the number of new manufacturing facilities/ expansions by global industrial companies in the US. The announcement of nearly 30 new or expanded manufacturing facilities being made mostly in traditionally weaker union regions in the southern US illustrates the theme of a global flow of capital into the US sector. These new facilities have not only increased the activities of multinational companies within the US, but have also added thousands of manufacturing jobs in the country. The decline in the US dollar versus the Chinese yuan is likely to increase the attractiveness of the US as a competitive location for export manufacturing, and strength in the Japanese yen is also pushing the decision for Japanese companies to actively shift their facilities away from the Chinese market.", "tag-5": "View the full article, \"Is There a US Manufacturing Renaissance?\", on the Citi GPS website."}
