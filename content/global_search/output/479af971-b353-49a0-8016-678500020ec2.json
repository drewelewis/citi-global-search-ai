The single largest part of the adult population (37.3 percent) invests up to CZK 10,000. Approximately one-fourth (25.5 percent) invest CZK 10,000 to 50,000 per year. Almost 30 percent do not invest at all. The survey has also shown that when it comes to growing their money through investment in financial products, Czechs still remain very conservative: more than 56 percent prefer savings products such as savings accounts or schemes of savings and loan associations. Traditional investment products for appreciation of financial assets over the long term, such as stocks, mutual funds, or bonds, are used by 40 percent of investors (13.5 percent stocks, 18.6 percent mutual funds, and 8.3 percent bonds). Short-term investments in forex products remain an underestimated opportunity and are currently used by only 3.2 percent of Czech investors.", "tag-1": "Czechs Overly Cautious with Investing, Missing Out on Attractive Opportunities", "tag-2": "PRAGUE \u2013 According to Citibank's latest survey conducted in cooperation with IPSOS, only every 14th Czech (7.4 percent) is willing to invest more than CZK 50,000 per year in financial products.

We prefer to opt for certainty with a low or ultimately even no return. At the same time, we are missing out on interesting investment opportunities.\"", "tag-4": "Men more courageous investors than women In respect to the volume of investments, men are the more daring investors. Sums greater than CZK 50,000 per year are invested by 9.5 percent of men, but only 5.2 percent of women. Women are more cautious, and their domain is up to CZK 10,000 investments. In addition, there are more women than men who do not invest at all (34 percent). Men who do not invest number fewer (26 percent). By age groups, sums over CZK 50,000 are most often invested by people aged 25 to 34 (9.2 percent), closely followed by people aged 55 to 65 (9.1 percent). On the other hand, people aged 35 to 45 are the most cautious: 6.9 percent of them invest more than CZK 50,000 per year.", "tag-5": "Investment opportunities also accessible starting from lower thresholds \"There may still be quite a few barriers inhibiting Czechs from investing more medium and higher amounts. On the one hand, the Czech investment market is still relatively young, and investors are still only shaping their own investment strategies. On the other hand, this restraint is apparently also attributable to bad experience in the recent and distant past. But concerns are not warranted. Collective forms of investment, diversified portfolios and, moreover, assistance provided by investment bankers \u2013 all of this brings a high level of protection for the investment and attractive returns,\" says David K\u00f6gler, adding: \"In the case of Citibank, and most recently in respect to its premium forex products, such products are accessible for investments from as low as CZK 100,000. These products also offer short-term growth, because they mature in the range from one week to three months.\" In premium forex products Citibank has traded more than CZK 2 billion since August 2013. According to Citibank's internal statistics, primarily men invest in premium forex products (80 percent). This only confirms the results of the survey, i.e., a larger proportion of men-investors. Investors' average age is 50.", "tag-6": "Citi Citi, the leading global bank, has approximately 200 million customer accounts and does business in more than 160 countries and jurisdictions.
