      "summary": "Moscow – Citibank and FSVC conducted 19 specialized training sessions on risk management in 11 Russian cities. Over three years, more than 780 regional banks' employees participated in training sessions and learned how to implement best banking practices. International experts led the sessions, and topics ranged from credit and operational risk management to the fundamentals of stress testing and lending for small- and medium-sized enterprises. The sessions helped bank employees further their ability to serve customers and will support access to banking products and services in their communities. Market turbulence over the past couple of years has had a profound effect on the banking industry and its approach to risk management and governance. In the aftermath of the crisis, the industry is anticipating new policies and regulations that will address some of the weaknesses and promote more robust risk management regimes. Citibank and FSVC held an expert panel discussion on banking risk management in the post-crisis environment to share the results of the Building Regional Bank Capacities program. The panel included prominent Russian and international industry thought leaders with extensive implementation expertise, including: Anatoly Aksakov, president of the Association of Regional Banks and a State Duma deputy; Allan Hirst, former president of ZAO Citibank and a member of the FSVC board; and Natalia Nikolaeva, ZAO Citibank Vice president. The panel also answered questions from employees at regional banks, the public and the media. Natalia Nikolaeva, vice president at ZAO Citibank, said: \"We think that FSVC's initiative is very timely and important for the Russian banking sector. That's why we provided them financial support for this program. We've all learned a lot from the crisis. We believe that given the current conditions, it is absolutely essential that advanced risk management processes are put in place in the regions, as this will ensure the stability of the whole Russian banking system.\" \"The recent economic crisis has demonstrated how important it is for the banking system and economy as a whole to have competent risk management,\" said the president of the Association of Regional Banks of Russia and a State Duma deputy Anatoly Aksakov. \"To support diversification and economic development, Russia should have a mature financial sector. The regional banks should staff qualified employees who are well oriented in the modern techniques of risk management. This was the goal of the joint programs of the Association of Regional Banks of Russia and the FSVC, supported by the Citi Foundation, and consulting projects of the Association and the International Finance Corporation. And I believe we have achieved major success in this area.\" \"In implementing risk management strategies, regional banks confront issues that are unique to banks of their size. This was particularly true during the crisis,\" said Tim O'Brien, FSVC regional director for Russia. \"Lessons from the crisis are still being interpreted, and there are many proposals out there that will have an impact on banking in Russia and other countries. This panel provided a practical dialogue on risk management and proposed regulatory changes such as Basel III.\"",

In it, he outlines the strong progress the firm made during the year as a \"New Citi\" emerged from a very challenging period in the financial services industry.<br><br>Mr. Pandit notes that Citi today is fundamentally different from the company of which he became CEO two years ago. Today, Citi is operating on a very strong foundation and is positioned to contribute to the economic recovery and generate sustained profitability for the benefit of all its stakeholders.<br><br>Citi has bolstered its financial strength, overhauled risk management, reduced risk exposures, defined a clear strategy and made the company a more focused enterprise by returning to banking as the core of its business. Mr. Pandit notes that Citi is now one of the best-capitalized banks in the world, with a Tier One Capital ratio of 11.7%, a Tier One Common ratio of 9.6% and loan loss reserves of $36 billion.<br><br>Mr. Pandit also thanks the U.S. government for providing Citi with TARP funds. For Citi, as for many other institutions, this investment built a bridge over the crisis to a sound footing on the other side, and it came from the American people. Citi has repaid the TARP investment the government made in December 2008 with a substantial return for taxpayers, and the value of the equity investment the government made in Citi has increased significantly. Mr. Pandit notes Citi also exited the loss-sharing arrangement with the government.

We have the power to book a dinner reservation, purchase movie tickets for afterward and ensure a cab is waiting at the end of evening - all from the palm of our hand. <br><br>So why should philanthropy be any different? This question rings especially true in light of the recent devastation in Haiti. <br><br><a href=\"https://blog.causeworld.com/\">CauseWorld</a>, a new application from shopkick for the iPhone and Android phones (with other platforms coming soon), lets users give back to important global causes simply by visiting businesses in their local area. <br><br>With each visit, the user earns \"karma points\" that they can donate to causes they choose from a list in the CauseWorld application. Users can donate to multiple causes, including the American Red Cross disaster relief in Haiti. <br><br>Citi and Kraft have provided nearly $500,000 in donations to power CauseWorld's launch. It is our hope that other companies will follow suit upon seeing the results that such an innovative business model can achieve. <br><br>The donation money is converted to the \"karma\" currency, and users spend the \"karmas\" on specific actions such as planting a tree or - in the case of the Haiti earthquake victims - providing emergency medical aid. For example, 100 karmas can plant a tree in the rainforest, while 30 karmas can provide clean water for someone in Sudan for one month. <br><br>CauseWorld is socially connected, as well. Each time a user makes a donation, they can post to their Facebook wall for all of their friends to see. This helps more people find CauseWorld. <br><br>We are always eager to support efforts that better our world. When it comes to CauseWorld, we are duly inspired by the fresh thinking behind that effort and excited to watch the mobile karma movement take flight. <br><br>CauseWorld is available for free at the <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewSoftware?id=343905383&amp;mt=8\">iPhone App store</a> and on Android devices.",

The seminar highlighted the fact that the insurance industry in Indonesia has a high-expected growth rate but there remains low market penetration, which reflects both the challenges and the opportunities in the country's insurance industry. \"Despite the total insurance premium growth of more than 30% in 2007, Indonesia remains a significantly under-penetrated insurance market. As the world's 20th largest economy in terms of GDP and fifth most populous nation, there are still great opportunities for growth,\" said Managing Director and Regional Industry Head of Financial Institutions for Citi Asia Pacific Region Peter Heidinger, speaking at the seminar.",
