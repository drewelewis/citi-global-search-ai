She inspired young people like me to become agents of change, to use our talents to solving issues that beset our country. I grew up actively involved in helping improve my communities, whether empowering girls through running teen leadership programs, or organizing conferences to mobilize Filipino youth to use science and technology for sustainable development. <br><br>I left my country to study, and eventually work, in North America. As a scholar at Mount Holyoke College, the first and oldest women's college in America, I was inducted into the global women's movement. Working for Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and Microsoft immersed me in the worlds of global finance, business, and technology. I was dazzled (and overwhelmed) by the many ways one could make a difference and change the world. <br><br>My biggest pivot point came while studying for my MBA at Harvard Business School. I purposefully chose to use those years to explore what major global challenge I wanted to solve in my lifetime, and how I would go about solving that challenge: <br><br>As my studies and work took me around the world, I embraced the belief that \"my community\" is a global one. Humanity is united by shared hopes and dreams - for happiness, love, success, meaning, and impact. However, it became clear to me that half the world's population - women - were mostly missing out on opportunities to realize our dreams, whether resulting from internal barriers or external circumstances and ceilings, whether in developing countries or in the developed world. I also cared deeply about sustainability, innovation, entrepreneurship, economic development, and fighting poverty. <br><br>What I thought was great about investing in women's potential, is that women also hold the key towards fighting poverty and sustainable development. If more women could be unleashed as successful entrepreneurs and innovators, the world would be a better place. <br><br>Thus, while at HBS, I put together the plan for what would eventually become the Womensphere community and social enterprise, which fosters a global renaissance and unleashing women's potential to create our future. Womensphere grew over the years, supported by an amazing network of individuals, partner companies, NGOs, universities, and institutions that share our purpose. Today, the Womensphere Foundation is building an Emerging Leaders Global Network, connecting and empowering the next generation of women leaders, creators, scientists, and innovators. We're investing in mentoring circles and scholarships for girls. Our Summits are platforms to exchange best practices in fostering gender equality and inclusive growth. We create programs that develop women as leaders and innovators. <br><br>This all came about after I carved out the space and time to answer a question posed by the great poet: \"What is it you plan to do with your one wild and precious life?\" There was no blueprint for uniting impact in this way - it had to be created. I think it's so important to purposefully initiate one's pivot point, to create both the inspiration and plan to fuel one's journey.","image":"638e340da3c47c530c0a6f7e","year":"2014","publishDate":"March 26, 2014","type":"insights","title":"Analisa Balares: My Pivot Point Led Me to Create a Global Social Enterprise","author.jobTitle":["CEO & Founder of Womensphere and the Womensphere Foundation, and a World Economic Forum Young Global Leader"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2014/analisa-balares-my-pivot-point-led-me-to-create-a-global-social-enterprise","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"03","author.displayName":["Analisa Balares"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"New York - Citi announced today that Heather Cox has been named Chief Client Experience, Digital and Marketing Officer for Global Consumer Banking.

It was then that I suddenly got laid off from a job I loved and immediately came to an emotionally perplexing crossroads in my career. <br><br>Should I immediately jump back into the job market and try to secure another full-time position similar to the one I held? Or, should I leverage this kick-in-the-pants moment to finally pursue my dream of launching my own company? <br><br>For years I'd been a dedicated, worker bee financial journalist, climbing my way up the media ladder, first as an editorial assistant at a magazine and later as a financial producer for a major New York City cable news provider. I'd launched an online video channel and had written for various publications for prominent entrepreneurship and financial publications. I'd even published my own book and had started doing more television appearances as a financial expert. I finally felt like I'd found my groove. <br><br>But then when I got my pink slip, it was clear that some things were simply out of my control. Just as millions of Americans were losing their jobs in the thrust of the Great Recession, I, too, became unemployed overnight. <br><br>I went through all the stages of grief: denial, anger...and finally (thankfully) acceptance. I accepted that, while some things were not quite in my control, others certainly were. I had the ability to create my own path and become my own boss. Thanks to a tight circle of friends, family and colleagues who believed in me and encouraged me to take a chance, I found the courage to abandon life as a full-time staffer to, instead, start fresh on my own, as the founder of Farnoosh, Inc., a one woman band providing financial advice and content to various audiences and across a number of media platforms. <br><br>I won't lie; it was scary to be on my own at first. Figuring out how to make ends meet, which opportunities to pursue and how to manage my time were all very challenging. But as my mother always said, you'll never quite know your true potential in life unless you venture outside your comfort zone. And sometimes, the best decisions in life are the ones made for you. <br><br>Getting laid off was a decision that was made for me. I didn't have a choice in the matter. But looking back it was the best predicament because it forced me to really examine my options and think more critically about my next steps. It's a lesson I take with me now whenever I find myself at a crossroads. <br><br>Take a risk and try something new.

My boss encouraged me to challenge myself, leverage my experience to grow faster, step out of my comfort zone and take more responsibilities. I was asked to leave a comfortable position I'd had for eight years managing a small area, and to take on more responsibility managing a different, bigger one. <br><br>In the beginning I was reluctant. I felt comfortable with my job and was afraid of not being able to grow professionally and still make time for my family. I changed my approach by involving my family in the decision making process and asking for their support. After doing a deep internal analysis of my personal and professional goals and dreams, and discussing it with my family, I decided to embrace the challenge and believed with my heart that I could handle both in a balanced manner. I changed my attitude and became more confident and aggressive about what I wanted and what I could achieve. <br><br>I now understand that sometimes assertive bosses and tough conversations that challenge you can make the biggest difference in your life. <strong>A great boss is the one that sees your potential and brings out the best in you even if it is painful.</strong> He or she also encourages you to get out of your comfort zone and go beyond your instinctive limits. I'm grateful that my boss was willing to push me to grow, and I realize now that even though that tough conversation wasn't enjoyable, it positively impacted both my personal and professional life. <br><br>Since that conversation, when I feel like I'm in my comfort zone, I seek opportunities to grow and challenge myself. Most recently, I have embarked on a new journey leaving behind my native Colombia to assume a new role as CCO of Trinidad, which has been an enriching experience but with a steep learning curve. From adapting to the culture and language, to new foods and thinking patterns, my family and I are being supportive of each other and embracing this new challenge. <br><br>I believe I am capable of keeping a good balance between my professional and personal life, which is one of my priorities. When new opportunities do arise, I sit down with my husband and our three kids to weigh the pros and cons, and make a decision as a family.","image":"638e3412a3c47c530c0a6f9c","year":"2014","publishDate":"March 18, 2014","type":"insights","title":"Catalina Herrera Roca: My Pivot Point Pushed Me Out of My Comfort Zone","author.jobTitle":["Citi Country Officer Trinidad & Tobago"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2014/catalina-herrera-roca-my-pivot-point-pushed-me-out-of-my-comfort-zone","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"03","author.displayName":["Catalina Herrera Roca"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"New York - John Gerspach, Chief Financial Officer, and Eric Aboaf, Treasurer, will conduct the Citigroup first quarter 2014 Fixed Income Investor Review at 10 a.m. (ET) on Thursday, April 17, 2014.

There was not one good thing that could possibly come from being passed up for a significant promotion and being layered. For half an hour, I stood there saying those same words over and over while I racked my brain, trying to generate an opportunity out of this. Finally, the words came to me: \"I am SO grateful for this career setback because it's going to take me to new heights. I'm going to break through these barriers and contribute at multiples beyond what this opportunity would have allowed. I will make this the great motivator and propeller in my life.\" <br><br>I immediately went on a 30-day journey where I set aside at least an hour every day--every single day--and took a much deeper look at my aspirations and capabilities as well as my ultimate purpose and vision. <br><br>I made many discoveries. <br><br>First, I discovered a limiting belief that I didn't realize I had. Somewhere in the deep recesses of my mind, I had it in my head that if I took a step up in terms of responsibilities I would have less time with my family. This limiting belief was holding me back at some unconscious level. I reframed it as follows: \"I can contribute at multiples and still have plenty of delicious family time.\" <br><br>Next, I realized that I had assumed my accomplishments spoke for themselves since I was a one-rated employee (the top rating for Citi employees). Clearly, that was not the case. I immediately got on the networking circuit and also arranged one-on-one meetings with three of the top senior leaders at Citi: the Chief Operating Officer, the Head of Human Resources, and the Head of Operations &amp; Technology. Although it was outside of my comfort zone to do so, I shared my accomplishments at each of these meetings and spoke to the level that I could contribute for Citi. <br><br>A few months later, while I was on a business trip in London, I received word that the head of Global Wealth Management wanted to speak with me about being his Chief Operating Officer. I had never met him in my life and honestly did not know a great deal about Wealth Management. Only after I got the job did I learn that three of his most trusted advisors were Citi's COO, Citi's Head of HR, and Citi's Head of O&amp;T, and all three had put my name forward for the position. I am convinced that if I had not met with each of them during the prior 90 days, I would not have been the first name on their lips. <br><br>To be clear, it wasn't being layered that led to this huge promotion but how I was able to reframe it that did. <br><br>Careers aren't made by how we handle the good times but by how we handle the difficult ones. If things aren't going the way you want, you have to dream bigger, be introspective, and take a deep look at what's holding you back. Ultimately, you're 100% responsible for your own success. And even if you don't exactly believe that's true, how else can you play it that leads to any meaningful results? There is no other way, so you might as well play like your success is completely in your hands by taking massive action and doing whatever it takes. For me, it took networking and declaring my accomplishments even though I wasn't really comfortable doing either. <br><br>This approach is now a big part of my tool chest in all areas of my life, from my career to my family to my charity work. If there is any area that is not performing in my life, then I uncover my limiting beliefs and then reframe the situation as an opportunity to take 100% responsibility for the outcomes. It's a much more fun way to live.","image":"638e3415a3c47c530c0a6fac","year":"2014","publishDate":"March 14, 2014","type":"insights","title":"Sheree Stomberg: My Pivot Point Taught Me to Reframe my Limiting Beliefs","author.jobTitle":["Global Head of Citi Shared Services and the CSC Delivery Network"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2014/sheree-stomberg-my-pivot-point-taught-me-to-reframe-my-limiting-beliefs","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"03","author.displayName":["Sheree Stomberg"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"Whether it's rapid population growth or how to deal with aging infrastructure, cities - at their core - face a common set of urban challenges.

That plan must be multi-faceted, involving both senior management and departments, and must take into account the interaction between different parts of the organization. <br><br>For the UN, this effort began in the aftermath of the 2004 Asian tsunami, one of the most devastating disasters in history as Citi colleagues in Bangkok offered assistance and support in a time of crisis and was proved to be vital as a storm struck the headquarters of the organization head on. <br><br>I'm honored that my own team is now helping ensure that the team at the United Nations can be as effective managing their own recovery as they are assisting people in need around the world. <br><br>","image":"638e3418a3c47c530c0a6fbe","year":"2014","publishDate":"March 13, 2014","type":"insights","title":"What the UN Can Teach Any Business About Disaster Preparation","author.jobTitle":["Managing Director, Global Head of Business Continuity, Citi Institutional Clients Group"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2014/what-the-un-can-teach-any-business-about-disaster-preparation","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"03","author.displayName":["Rudy Garcia"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"Citi was named Best Bank in Asia by <i>The Asset</i> Magazine at the annual Triple-A 2013 regional banking awards.

I've had a handful of these myself, including those perfect words of wisdom from mentors and a few significant career changes. <br><br>But the biggest lesson I've learned is <strong>perseverance comes from setbacks and failures. Picking yourself up and regaining confidence is a critical skill to be successful.</strong> After being fired from my first job, I learned to do just that. <br><br>In today's business speak, I had a skills gap. I believed I was qualified for my first job that required attention to detail and organization, but I couldn't even keep my own bedroom clean. I was young and thought I was made for anything. I was wrong, and I was fired. <br><br>What I lacked in folding skills I made up for in perseverance. I picked myself up and a week later I created my own job. I walked into the new health food store in my town with a fruit drink. Today we'd call it a smoothie, but back then it was an innovative new concept. I asked the owner to sell this in the store and he gave me one Saturday to prove myself. And I did.

I learned how to \"fail up.\" <br><br>More than five years ago when I was named the President and CEO of the Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship (NFTE), I knew I had found the right place for me.

So, we teach our students to think and act like entrepreneurs. <br><br>At the heart of being an entrepreneur is learning to \"fail up\" and create opportunity from things that you love. Success is not going to come from doing what you are not good at. Innovate around your personal passions. <br><br>I urge all leaders, successful business owners and entrepreneurs to speak up publicly and share failures to show our young people how to be persistent and adapt in an evolving global economy. <br><br>Let's not be confused anymore, failure isn't fatal!

Tell us about how that experience impacted you. </strong> <br><br>A: It was tough adjusting to life after being injured overseas. I was a very active guy - I loved playing basketball, running around, playing soccer, you name it, so for me to be injured and have to sit in bed for a couple months was hard. For anyone suffering through a similar injury, I would say keep your head up, stay positive and don't focus on the things you can't do. Just look forward, look to the future. <br><br><strong>Q: How did you get started with sled hockey? </strong> <br><br>A: A veteran asked me to come out and try the sport -- it was facilitated through the Operation Comfort program -- and he really had to twist my arm to make me try it. I did not want to play hockey. I didn't watch hockey or play hockey at the time, so I am really grateful that he brought me out there and encouraged me to get involved. It impacted my life in a positive way. <br><strong><br>Q: Describe you first experience on the ice. </strong> <br><br>A: My first time on the ice was tough because I was very fast, but I couldn't turn or stop. I would go a hundred miles an hour and just run into the boards. It was difficult and the guys were laughing at me, but as time went on I got better at it. The first time I noticed I was hooked on the sport was when we started getting physical. We wore full pads just like a stand-up hockey player, and we started running into each other and that got me hooked right away. <br><br><strong>Q: How did you stay focused when you didn't make the Vancouver squad? </strong> <br><br>A: The first time I tried out for the U.S. Paralympic team I thought 'I'm a veteran, I'm in the best shape of my life and it is going to be a breeze to make this team.' That was not the case. They were flying all around me and I thought to myself, 'I want to be on this team next year, and I want to be in the 2014 Paralympic Winter Games,' so that really fired me up. Since I didn't make that team, it really pushed me that year to work as hard as I could. <br><strong><br>Q: What does the Operation Comfort program mean to you? </strong> <br><br>A: They do so many things for the veterans! They are at your bedside asking you to come out and do biking, when you may be thinking, 'What are you talking about? I'm missing a leg?' But they look to the things that you can do, and really try to bring that camaraderie back and to get injured veterans active.

The requirements to make the team were clear: you needed to be tall and athletic. At 6 feet tall and with a long sports history, I fit the bill. <br><br>The collegiate rowing calendar is year-long, culminating in the championship races. Despite a promising start to the season, I was soon injured, resulting in persistent pain throughout the year. To further impact my precarious position on the team, I missed a key spring race to visit my mom, who had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer. My injury and the decision to see my family caused the coach to question my commitment and value to the team. <br><br><strong>Despite these setbacks, I was determined to not give up and to prove I had what it took to make it into the championship boat.</strong> Only weeks before the championship races, I saw my chance one afternoon in practice. The coach pulled out four small boats called pairs. Pairs are designed for only two people with one oar on each side of the boat. The thing about pairs is if one person doesn't row with the same intensity and precision as the other, the boat will go in circles. <br><br>The coach asked me to get in a boat with a weak rower, indicating what she thought of me. At that moment, I noticed one of the strongest rowers was looking for a partner and volunteered to be in her boat. Both she and my coach were skeptical, but agreed. <br><br>That afternoon, our boat was the clear leader and we won every sprint by a wide margin. When we returned to the dock after practice, the coach mentioned to her assistant that she had found her top pair. I was back in the boat! <br><br>The opportunity presented that afternoon was a pivot point for me. I do not regret going to see my mom in her time of need and taking the time to heal my injury. Yet, <strong>to get back into the boat, I needed both to persevere and wait for a chance to prove myself to my coach and my team.</strong> This lesson of patience and persistence continues to be invaluable for my career at Citi. <br><br>There have been many times as a banker when I've experienced career setbacks, when circumstances make it seem like it is impossible to change a situation. I often remember my experiences as a rower and know that if I work hard and keep at it, opportunities will always open up to demonstrate the value I can bring to the wider team.","image":"638e341ca3c47c530c0a6fd7","year":"2014","publishDate":"March 10, 2014","type":"insights","title":"Kristine Braden: My Pivot Point Taught Me the Value of Perseverance and Opportunity","author.jobTitle":["Head of Europe for Global Subsidiaries Group, Citi"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2014/kristine-braden-my-pivot-point-taught-me-the-value-of-perseverance-and-opportunity","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"03","author.displayName":["Kristine Braden"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"Join us as we profile nine Team Citi athletes on the Citi Blog as part of our Every Step of the Way program. <br><br>Up next is Alana Nichols, U.S. Paralympian in alpine skiing and wheelchair basketball.Alana's love for sports didn't stop even after an accident left her paralyzed in her teens. She understands how transformative - and expensive - Paralympic sport can be and has chosen to support the Team USA Paralympic Champions Fund to make Paralympic sport more accessible. <br><br><strong>Q: You've faced many tough moments throughout your life. How did adversity shape the way you approach sports and life? </strong> <br><br>A: I was a hopeful seventeen year old, ready to take over the world, when I broke my back in a snowboarding accident. As an athlete, becoming paralyzed was absolutely one of the hardest thing I could have imagined happening to me. I always identified myself as an athlete, but I did not think that it would be possible after my accident. It was not until I was fortunate enough to be introduced to wheelchair basketball that I found myself again and became the athlete I always was. Losing my brother was another hard thing I had to deal with. Having that loss overtake me right before the Vancouver 2010 Paralympic Winter Games, I thought that I wasn't going to be able to perform. But with the support of my family, I was able to turn his loss into my inspiration and win for him. <br><br><strong>Q: How did you manage to stay so positive through the tough times? Have you always had this positive outlook? <br></strong> <br>A: I wouldn't say I've always had a positive outlook. Anybody that is put in a tough position is given a choice. You have to decide whether you are going to sink or swim and for me it just seems so black and white - I could dig myself a hole or I could feel the pain and then move on. Knowing this helped me have a positive outlook and attitude. <br><strong><br>Q: Why is Paralympic sport so important for people with physical disabilities? </strong> <br><br>A: Paralympic sport is life-changing for some individuals with disabilities. From a personal perspective, I thought my life was over after my accident, but I was given a whole new breath of life when I learned about Paralympic sport programs. And for other people with disabilities, it gives them confidence and hope for their future. Without Paralympic sport programs, people with disabilities aren't given the same opportunity to be the best athletes that they can be, and it's incredibly important to have them. <br><strong><br>Q: What are some of the financial challenges faced by Paralympic athletes? </strong> <br><br>A: Without the same media coverage as able-bodied candidates, sponsorship is not as accessible for us. So many Paralympic athletes are often left working full-time jobs, and some of us have families to support. They literally have to quit doing the sport that they love because they can't afford it, and that's one of the most disappointing things. <br><br>The Team USA Paralympic Champions Fund was put into place by U.S. Paralympics to support elite-level athletes and their journey to the Paralympic Games.

Addressing an audience that included mobile operators, device manufacturers, technology providers, and retailers from across the world, I summarized Citi's position in my opening line: <em>\"At Citi we see ourselves as both enabling mobile retail and being a mobile retailer ourselves.\" </em> <br /><br />My presentation focused on three trends impacting mobile retail: <br /><br />1. \"Products and services are increasingly being commoditized, and mobile commerce has the potential to both accelerate and alleviate this commoditization.\" <br /><br />There are two avenues to addressing commoditization. First, personalize products and services. Second, create unique consumer experiences. To do this effectively, you need to understand your customers. Mobile provides the best channel for consumers to access their preferences and a powerful platform for providers to capture data and deliver unique experiences. Leveraging these attributes, providers can deliver personal and contextual shopping interactions - enabling a blending of online and offline experiences. <br /><br />2. \"Distribution, both online and offline, has been the last great battleground for mobile commerce adoption - and that gridlock is starting to change.\" <br /><br />Despite these challenges, the emergence of new technology standards and platforms is beginning to alter the distribution landscape and break down existing barriers. These standards and platforms reduce cost and complexity as well as enabling payment credentials to be used securely and efficiently across online and physical transaction environments. <br /><br />3. \"Getting beyond plastic, we need a compelling value proposition, and consumer protection may be it.\" <br /><br />As we have seen in the recent security breaches of prominent retailers in the United States, security and protection remain at the top of consumer concerns. If we, as an industry, can develop the standards and technology to reduce the risk and impact of data theft, then I believe many customers would understand and value the additional protection provided. This would encourage the development and use of new digital products - for e-Commerce as well as the proximity, tap-and-pay transactions. <br /><br />What does all this mean for Citi? As a \"retailer\", we will continue to invest in great mobile experiences, work with partners to access ubiquitous acceptance and ensure we protect our customers. As an enabler of Commerce we need to facilitate commerce between merchants and consumers but not get in the middle. <br /><br />Some of our best successes have been where we work in partnership with merchants. Our mobile wallet in Hong Kong includes the leading grocery, pharmaceutical and electrical merchants. In Mexico our mobile wallet includes the largest convenience site as a partner. And in the USA our retail partner business supports thousands of merchants in delivering commerce solutions to their clients. <br /><br />While we focus on delivering a \"better by far\" experience to our customers, we will continue to work with our merchant partners to ensure they can deliver great commerce experiences to their clients.</p>","image":"638e3420a3c47c530c0a6ff0","year":"2014","publishDate":"March 05, 2014","type":"insights","title":"Mobile Retail: The One Stop Shop","author.jobTitle":["Managing Director, Citi Global Head of Digital Strategy"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2014/lessons-from-mobile-world-congress","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"03","author.displayName":["Greg Baxter"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"<em>To celebrate International Women's Day, Christine Lam, Country Business Manager for Citi, shares her pivot point. </em> <br><br>\"30 years, and counting.\" This is typically how I introduce my career at Citi. It has been an eventful, exciting journey and there have been many career defining moments along the way. <br><br>I started out a single mother of a young son and traveled incessantly for work. I was spending time with my child one Sunday morning when I saw him washing his hands in the bathroom, without having to rely on the step-up stool. My son was tall enough to wash his hands without help, and I had missed all that growing up! <br><br>In that one instant, I felt more guilt and heartache than words could describe. I was distraught the rest of the day, and went over in my head multiple times the difficult conversation I would have with my boss the next day. This was my pivot point - a resolute desire to achieve better work life balance and spend more time being a mom. <strong>I resolved to make up for lost motherhood,</strong> which, for me, meant a significant cut back in business travel. <br><br>There was in fact far less drama on Monday. My boss listened, expressed empathy and understanding, and we worked out a plan for me to cover one of the markets, effectively halving my travel. In the end, the business did not suffer. We more than achieved the targets, and the business left a lasting legacy in the market. <br><br>When I look back on this episode from decades back,<strong> I realize how one could over-engineer the down side risk to career conversations, and underestimate the support from managers for the right work life balance.</strong> Make no mistake, a career at Citi is demanding, but there is more than one way to achieve professional goals. <br><br>At a practical level, striking a balance requires making a conscious choice.

She supports the USA Hockey Foundation's Try Hockey For Free Days, a program that every year offers thousands of kids across the country the opportunity to experience the excitement of playing hockey for the very first time. Learn what drives her success. <br><strong><br>Q: You originally were a figure skater. Why did you switch to hockey? </strong> <br><br>A: When I was 8 years old, I was signed up for figure skating along with my sister while my brother was signed up for hockey. Those were the stereotypical divides at the time. During my first two months in figure skates my eyes kept wandering towards the side where the boys were playing hockey, and they just seemed to be having a lot of fun. I asked my parents if I could play hockey, and it's been amazing ever since. <br><strong><br>Q: What was it like playing hockey with the boys as the only girl? </strong> <br><br>A: If I was teased it was normally by players on the other team. Occasionally I'd be lined up at a face off, and with the last name Chu, I would hear someone next to me go 'Achoo' and kind of sneeze next to me, trying to make fun of my name. Although there were girls teams available, I continued playing on the boys hockey team until I was 17 years old. At that point boys got taller, and a lot heavier than me, and they tended to want to go after the girl a little bit more. I think that was the time when I had the opportunity to switch to girl's hockey. <br><strong><br>Q: Do you have a personal mantra? </strong> <br><br>A: My personal mantra is to 'live the life I love' and embrace it with enthusiasm. I believe that when I approach everything in my life with enthusiasm -- whether it is about mundane things, or something I am not really sure I will enjoy -- I find that I get more out of these situations when I have the right attitude. <br><strong><br>Q: To what do you attribute your incredible career? </strong> <br><br>A: I cannot say that I am the most skilled or the fastest player. I believe that I have been able to be on the national team since the year 2000 because I have been a very consistent player. I'm willing to work hard every day and prepare in order to execute when time comes. I take a lot of pride in the fact that every day, every game, my teammates and my coaches know what they are going to get from me. <br><strong><br>Q: You're looked at as a huge role model and you support the USA Hockey Foundation. How has this mission impacted kids' lives? </strong> <br><br>A: I'm very fortunate to be working with the USA Hockey Foundation and their Try Hockey For Free Days. It is a great initiative because hockey in general isn't the most accessible sport to everyone--getting equipment and ice time can be difficult. The program allows kids to come to a local rink, borrow equipment and try hockey for free. I want women's hockey to continue growing, and I think the Try Hockey For Free Days program does exactly that. <br><br><a href=\"https://everystep.citi.com/#julie\">Learn more</a> about how you can support Julie and the USA Hockey Foundations' Try Hockey for Free Days program.","image":"638e3427a3c47c530c0a7017","month":"02","year":"2014","publishDate":"February 21, 2014","siteId":"citigpa","type":"insights","title":"Q&A with Citi Team Member Julie Chu: Driven and Enthusiastic","category":"PERSPECTIVES","url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2014/qa-with-citi-team-member-julie-chu-driven-and-enthusiastic","tags":["Perspective Migration"]},{"month":"02","destinationLink":"https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/cdir-innovative.pdf","year":"2014","publishDate":"February 19, 2014","siteId":"citigpa","type":"insights","title":"How high-capacity, entrepreneurial nonprofit organizations are using innovative solutions to stem the tide of foreclosures and stabilize affected communities.","category":"PRESS RELEASE","url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/foundation/news/press-release/2014/how-high-capacity-entrepreneurial-nonprofit-organizations-are-using-innovative-solutions-to-stem-the-tide-of-foreclosures-and-stabilize-affected-communities-","tags":["Destination Link"]},{"summary":"Prague - The popularity of comfortable travel coupled with visits to exclusive airport lounges before departure has noticeably increased among Czechs.

In fact, next to health care, retirement ranked #2 of financial issues keeping Americans awake at night. <br><br>Saving enough for a comfortable retirement can seem utterly daunting. But there are ways to supercharge your retirement savings. Here are 5 ideas to consider: <br><br>1. Make time your friend. Starting early and saving consistently is the best gift you can give your future self. The earlier you start, the more money you have working for you (through compounding) and the more you can potentially earn. <br><br>2. Do the math. Take advantage of online retirement calculators to help you think through your retirement goals and how to fund them. Your bank probably offers one, and you also may want to check out calculators from <a href=\"https://www.choosetosave.org/ballpark/\">Choose to Save </a>and <a href=\"https://www.aarp.org/work/retirement-planning/retirement_calculator/\">AARP</a>. Keep in mind that the questions are different, so you may wind up with different results. And remember: you don't have to do this alone. A financial professional can work with you to create a personal action plan that fits your life and dreams. <br><br>3. Don't leave money on the table. Many employers will match employee contributions to a 401(k) or 403(b) plan, up to a pre-set cap. In some companies, the match could be as high as 50%, so for every $1 you contribute, your employer would contribute 50 cents. It's free money, so why pass it up? <br><br>4. Aim for the ceiling, not the floor. Every year the Internal Revenue Service updates the maximum taxpayers can put away in 401(k)s and/or IRAs. Check the IRS website for the <a href=\"https://www.irs.gov/uac/IRS-Announces-2014-Pension-Plan-Limitations;-Taxpayers-May-Contribute-up-to-$17,500-to-their-401(k)-plans-in-2014\">2014 limits</a> and strive to increase - if not max out - your contributions if you can. <br><br>5. Play catch up. If you are age 50 or over, take advantage of the IRS rule that allows you to make an additional contribution to qualified retirement accounts, e.g., 401(k)s, 403(b)s and IRAs. <br><br>For additional help take your retirement planning up a notch (or two!), don't forget that Citi's Women &amp; Co. has a range of retirement resources to help.","image":"638e3428a3c47c530c0a701e","year":"2014","publishDate":"February 18, 2014","type":"insights","title":"5 Ideas to Supercharge Your Retirement Savings","author.jobTitle":["Managing Director and Head, Content & Social, Global Consumer Bank"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2014/5-ideas-to-supercharge-your-retirement-savings","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"02","author.displayName":["Linda Descano"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"Bangkok - Citi announced its house-view preference of equities over fixed income classes, urging investors to seek out investment opportunities in Europe, Japan, the U.S. and North Asia, the bank shared in its Citigold 2014 Annual Outlook: 'Transitioning to Growth.'

Erin has chosen to support the USA Slider Search program, a national recruitment tour to help identify and instruct young luge athletes. <br><br>We learned what fueled her progress: her go-for-it attitude, hard work, loud cheers and more. <br><br>Q: Did luge come naturally to you or was it something you had to work at to gain success? <br><br>A: I did not naturally stand out in my first years practicing the sport. I had to work pretty hard to achieve the goals that I have set for myself, but also to get to the same standard level as everyone else around me. I was never the fastest, and I was never the best at the start. I was always kind of middle of the pack, but did my thing at a slow and steady pace and just learned everything I could. I think I was like the sleeping giant, I was just there, and then something clicked at some point and I just started going fast. <br><br>Q: You had a tough day before that victory at the World Championship due to migraines. What do you tell yourself and others to overcome an obstacle like that? <br><br>A: I think knowing what you have to do to get through the migraines is important. In those situations you feel like everything is working against you, but you've put in too much work and time to let something take you out of the game. As athletes, we've been in pain in the gym and in a lot of other ways, so when things are against you, it's almost more satisfying to come out on top. <br><br>Q: Your comfort zone is Lake Placid; you must have a lot of fan support there. <br><br>A: I am from a very small rural area in upstate New York and I've pretty much gotten them all to be luge fans, which is amazing. Every time I race in Lake Placid, I definitely get the loudest cheers. My family members have been pretty die hard luge fans, they have rallied through years and years of standing in the cold and traveling. My brothers are pretty famous for being the chest-painted crew at the Olympic Games and other big races and in the past. <br><br>Q: Your dedication to the sport is shown with the USA Luge Slider Search Program.

Without missing a beat, regardless of whether it was a pair of shoes, a handbag or make-up, I would say $100, albeit with a wink and smile. He inevitably would reply that what I did with my money was my business, he was just curious. Sweet, right? Not so fast. <br><br>Truth be told, I actually did care about what he was doing with his money - quite a bit. That's when I decided no more financial fibbing - even if it was in jest. I came clean on what I was actually spending and proposed that we set ground rules about how we would approach our, his and my money. Scott readily agreed. In fact, when he proposed, he took our financial fidelity to the next level baring his financial soul, from what he had in savings to what he owed, even providing back-up documentation.

In partnership with Citi, Ted is supporting the Youth Enrichment Services' Operation SnowSports program. Funds from Citi's donation will help pay for urban youth to get outdoors where they'll learn how to ski and snowboard and, in turn, build self-confidence and gain invaluable life skills. <br><strong><br>Q: You suffered from a devastating knee injury on a training run back at the 2009 U.S. Nationals. How did that impact you and your view of the sport? </strong> <br><br>A: At the 2009 Nationals in Alaska I took a hard fall on the downhill training run and tore my MCL, PCL and had a big bone bruise. I had to take my first toboggan ride of my career, which is not a fun experience, and then I was in a straight leg brace for 8 weeks, non-weight bearing. Sitting on the couch is not something I like to do, and it was difficult being inactive for that long. It also was a huge motivator for me because I knew that I wanted to continue ski racing, and it really gave me appreciation for my love of ski racing and extra drive to keep moving forward. <br><br><strong>Q: You placed a grim 70th in your first Junior Olympic Games and you were dismissed as a mediocre racer. How did convince yourself to keep moving forward? </strong> <br><br>A: When I was younger I got beat pretty badly in most of the races I entered, but one thing that was a good motivator for me was watching their video and then watching my video. In a lot of ways I thought I skied better than they did, I just didn't have the same speed and size, especially at those younger ages of 12 and 13. A lot of guys I was competing against were almost men, so I definitely knew that was a disadvantage, but I also knew by watching myself ski and how comfortable I was on my skis that I'd eventually figure it out. <br><br><strong>Q: Passing on knowledge and expertise is so important that you're fully engaged with the Youth Enrichment Services operation. How does the work inspire you? </strong> <br><br>A: It's really cool being involved with YES, the Youth Enrichment Services. They help inner city kids who normally wouldn't have the opportunity to ski get on the slopes. It's amazing to help give kids the chance to enjoy the mountains, get out and ski, push themselves and learn the independence of how to do a snow sport. <br><br><strong>Q: Ted, you talked about the importance of kids and skiing, could you share with us a story from your childhood that had to do with skiing? </strong> <br><br>A: I grew up in Park City, Utah, so the really the obvious thing to do is to ski. My parents would go to work and drop my brother and me off and we'd go skiing all day, then they'd come and pick us up in the afternoon - the mountains were like our babysitter. It was a great way to fall in love with the sport being on the mountains pushing yourself with your friends. I was also able to go to Tommy Moe ski camps where he coached when I was a kid - he was one of my idols and a big inspiration for me. That's a big reason of why I like to coach young kids at this point in my career. <br><br><a href=\"https://everystep.citi.com/#rico\">Learn more</a> about how you can support Ted and Youth Enrichment Services.","image":"638e342ba3c47c530c0a7033","month":"02","year":"2014","publishDate":"February 10, 2014","siteId":"citigpa","type":"insights","title":"Q&A with Team Citi Member Ted Ligety: Beating the Odds and Passing on the Passion","category":"PERSPECTIVES","url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2014/qa-with-team-citi-member-ted-ligety-beating-the-odds-and-passing-on-the-passion","tags":["Perspective Migration"]},{"summary":"Since its inception, Citi and the Citi Foundation have worked tirelessly to promote economic progress in communities across the globe.

He supports Figure Skating in Harlem, a non-profit program that uses academics and figure skating to empower girls in some of New York City's most underserved areas. <br><br>Evan's first encounter with the sport was far from love at first sight. See what fueled his progress. <br><br><br>Q: You were 8 when you got on ice for the first time, and you did not like it. Tell us about that. <br><br>A: I went to the local rink outside of Chicago with my older sister and we were both going to start skating. She was naturally talented at most sports, so needless to say that she got on the ice and skated away. When I stepped onto the ice, before my second foot even hit the ice I went down. I tried desperately to get up but I just kept falling over and over. Somehow I found my way to my feet and I said, \"That's it, no more skating.\" My mom asked, \"Well, why?\" I told her I wanted to quit skating because my sister was better than me. She said, \"Evan, if someone is better than you at something, then you have to work harder than them.\" That stuck with me for my entire life. <br><br>Q: Tell us about your first major competition. <br><br>A: My first real competition was the Upper Great Lakes Regionals, and it qualified me for the Junior Olympic Championship. I didn't know anything about skating at the time. I remember the other skaters in the group standing where I was getting off laughing at me. I didn't know if it was because my technique was funny, because I was wearing a sweat suit, or because my parents cut my music at home on our double cassette tape deck. But I just knew I didn't really belong in this world. So when I qualified for the Junior Olympic Games, no one was more surprised than I was. <br><br>Q: You faced some challenges at the 2006 Olympic Winter Games in Turin when you were hospitalized. Tell us about that experience. <br><br>A: I got to the rink, and I did not feel like myself. I finished that program missing two jumps and a spin. I've never been so humiliated in my life. I felt like it was over. I woke up the next morning in a medical clinic in Turin. My coach walked into the room and said, \"You'll just rest today, and then we'll be good for the long program tomorrow.\" I said, \"Are you joking? I want to go home.\" He said, \"Okay, if you want to walk away now, it's your decision but you have worked hard to get here.\" A little reverse psychology snapped me right out of it. The next day I didn't feel any better, but I pushed through my routine and nailed one exercise after another. I ended in fourth place. <br><br>Q: Tell us about the program you support. <br><br>A: Figure Skating in Harlem is the first program in the country that uses academics and figure skating to change young lives. We work with girls from some of New York City's poorest communities. Our mission is to help instill leadership skills, confidence, and academic achievement, and we do this by promoting physical, emotional and intellectual well-being. <br><br><a href=\"https://everystep.citi.com/#evan\">Learn more</a> about how you can support Evan and Figure Skating in Harlem.","image":"638e342da3c47c530c0a7041","month":"02","year":"2014","publishDate":"February 06, 2014","siteId":"citigpa","type":"insights","title":"Q&A with Team Citi Member Evan Lysacek: Hard Work and Overcoming Mental Hurdles","category":"PERSPECTIVES","url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2014/qa-with-team-citi-member-evan-lysacek-hard-work-and-overcoming-mental-hurdles","tags":["Perspective Migration"]},{"image":"638e342ea3c47c530c0a7048","month":"02","year":"2014","publishDate":"February 06, 2014","siteId":"citigpa","type":"insights","title":"#ProgressMakers Twitter Chat Yields Compelling Insights on Urban Startups","category":"PERSPECTIVES","url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2014/progressmakers-twitter-chat-yields-compelling-insights-on-urban-startups","tags":["Perspective Migration"]},{"summary":"New York - Jud Linville, Chief Executive Officer of Citi Cards, will present at the 2014 Credit Suisse Financial Services Forum on Wednesday, February 12, 2014.

What was your relationship like with Jane? <br><br>A: Jane was a huge influence on me as I was growing up. She was the one who made me believe that I could do whatever I wanted, whether it was being a professional baseball player or a world champion skater. She believed in me, which made me believe in myself. <br><br>Q: Can you reflect on the moment when you learned that Jane had passed? <br><br>A: Looking back, 1988 was one of the toughest, if not the toughest time of my life. Jane had been fighting for her health for a year. It was tough trying to keep my focus and train for the upcoming Olympic Winter Games in Calgary. <br><br>Then the morning of my 500 meters race, I got the call that she wouldn't make it through the day and she passed away. I had been somewhat prepared for this moment, but I'm not even sure how to describe it other than there was no mental or physical preparation. I didn't even know if I should go out and skate, but I knew that if I didn't, she would have felt terrible. And so I decided to give it a shot. <br><br>It obviously didn't work out; I fell on the very first turn. My mind was in one place and the body was in another, but I wouldn't have done it any differently even if I could. <br><br>Q: How did you manage to persevere and push forward to your next victories? <br><br>A: A couple things gave me the power and the will to continue. First, the support system I had from my family. Second, it helped knowing that my family went through it together, but it just happened to be me on the world stage at the time. They were able to help me refocus and assured me that they would be by my side whether I choose to continue to skate or not. <br><br>Q: You are the embodiment of the Olympic Spirit. How exciting is it for you to stay connected to the Olympic Movement and Team USA as an ambassador for Citi and a commentator for NBC? <br><br>A: Sochi will be my fifth Olympic Games as a commentator, and it's great. It keeps me close to the sport, and I get back in the feeling of the excitement of the Games. And now with Citi's Every Step of the Way program, I'm glad to have another way to not only be involved, but be able to provide support. Olympians for Olympians Relief Fund is a terrific organization, which helps athletes who have come across hard times. People don't realize that the USA is one of a few countries where the Olympic Team isn't funded by the government.

Given such benefits--which can ultimately increase tax revenues by moving part of the informal economy into the formal sector--many countries are embarking on initiatives that aim to reach the estimated 60-70 percent of Latin Americans who are unbanked. <br><br>With the majority of Latin America's adults owning a cell phone, it makes sense to use mobile devices to receive and send payments and access other financial services. The importance of mobile cash was underscored by the decision of Mexico--which has one of the most advanced frameworks for mobile cash in the region--to make financial inclusion a key part of the agenda of the G20 summit it hosted in June 2012. <br><br>Mobile money offers huge opportunities for governments to reduce corruption and establish systems that deliver transparency, control, and audit capabilities as well as vastly reduce costs. All governments in Latin America make some payments in the form of welfare or other social transfers, known as Conditional Cash Transfers. These programs are designed to help alleviate poverty and improve living standards, and often they are associated with socially advantageous goals, such as improving access to education and healthcare so that citizens can live a fuller and more economically active life. <br><br>Social transfers are estimated to total around $1 trillion per year in emerging markets countries. Often, these payments are made in cash because the recipients are unbanked. Cash payments are inefficient and expensive, costing between 10 and 100 times more than electronic payments. Perhaps most importantly, cash payments offer few controls and require multiple intermediaries, resulting in some citizens never receiving their remittances. <br><br>Mobile money provides a safer way to obtain social payments and the convenience of immediate access to funds. The bank-based model of mobile cash being implemented in Latin America effectively uses mobile phones as a way to open a bank account without visiting a branch. Once people have a simplified bank account, they can not only receive and make payments to relatives or pay bills, for example, but also begin to save, insure themselves and even borrow funds from microfinance organizations to grow their businesses. Ultimately, mobile phones can be the channel through which financial services providers could sustainably deliver quality, affordable financial products to unbanked segments of the population in a highly convenient and efficient way. <br><br>","image":"638e343aa3c47c530c0a709b","year":"2014","publishDate":"January 26, 2014","type":"insights","title":" Mobile Money Uses Cell Phones to Connect Latin America","author.jobTitle":["Regional Head, Latin America, Citi Public Sector Group"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2014/mobile-money-uses-cell-phones-to-connect-latin-america","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"01","author.displayName":["Jorg Paasche"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"Join us as we profile <a href=\"https://blog.citigroup.com/2014/01/meet-our-9-team-citi-athletes-hear-their-stories-and-learn-about-their-passions.shtml\">nine Team Citi athletes</a> on the Citi Blog as part of our <a href=\"https://citi.us/1g6zvmg\">Every Step of the Way</a> program. <br><br>Billy Demong is a nordic combined skier and U.S. Olympic gold and silver medalist. Billy is passionate about being a role model to the next generation of athletes and has chosen to support Team for Tomorrow, a program that helps U.S. athletes spread the Olympic values of respect, excellence and friendship to their hometowns and training communities. <br><br><strong>Q: Growing up near Lake Placid served as a terrific landscape for your outstanding Olympic career. Can you reflect on your younger years? </strong> <br><br>A: I grew up listening to the stories of my parents attending the medal ceremonies for Eric Heiden and taking part in the mass crowd of the Miracle on Ice celebration at the 1980 Olympic Winter Games in Lake Placid. They stayed with me through my childhood and inspired me to pursue my dreams of becoming an athlete. <br><br><strong>Q: In 2002, it must have been a very scary moment when you dove into that hotel pool that left you unconscious with a severe head injury. How life-changing was that fractured skull? </strong> <br><br>A: I was in Germany at a training camp when I had a bad dive. Every athlete's worst nightmare is to be paralyzed, and I thought I had a broken neck. I got to the hospital and realized I suffered a massive skull fracture that left me without short term memory and good concentration for almost nine months after the fact. <br><br>I'd been on the ski team for four or five years at that point and skiing was my life, so to take that year off was a big change for me. I went back to school, trained toward my weaker sport of cross-country skiing and worked in construction, which was something I was always interested in. I grew as an endurance athlete and realized that there are opportunities outside of sports. <br><br>But after that year away from competitive skiing, I had a decision to make - did I want to keep moving forward in my new life as a student and a carpenter, or did I want to go back into competitive sport? It was an easy answer for me - I chose to be a world-class athlete. Because I knew there were other things outside of competition, I started to enjoy myself a lot more and didn't live and die by my results. I was able to focus on day-to-day training and leave the bad days behind me. <br><strong><br>Q: Giving back to the sport is a high priority for you. As a supporter of Team for Tomorrow, what are the ways that you show that kind of dedication? </strong> <br><br>A: Team for Tomorrow is a great program, enabling athletes to reach out to the youth in the communities that they grew up or reside in by hosting events and days where kids can come mingle. The young people really get to see what it is to be a world-class athlete and have a role model to look up to. The kids who are inspired by the Olympic athletes of today will be the Olympic athletes of tomorrow.

Picabo has chosen to support the Team USA Stay on the Slopes Initiative to provide injury prevention technology to keep athletes injury-free on and off the slopes. <br><br>We learned what fueled her progress: determination to overcome and belief in herself. <br><br><strong>Q: You were five when you taught yourself to ski. How determined were you to ski? </strong> <br><br>A: My father used to go off to ski with my brother and leave me at home. It made me so angry, and finally one day I asked him, \"What do I have to do to be able to go?\" He replied, \"Well, you have to learn how to ski first,\" and that was it. I put my brother's skis, boots and poles on, made myself a track in the sage brush and taught myself how to ski. <br><br><strong>Q: How did that determination play out later when your coaches suspended you for lack of determination and you trained in Hawaii to come back? </strong> <br><br>A: Most people go to Hawaii to kick back on the beach and maybe have a barbecue. I went to Hawaii for boot camp. I did sit-ups and pushups for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I moved piles of rock just because my dad told me to. I swam out in the ocean, which scared the bejesus out of me, but I was out there swimming in it anyway. And when I got back to the ski team, I was bound and determined to prove to them that I had that attitude adjustment and was in good physical condition. I did my pushups knuckle style on the track until they told me to stop, because I could've done it forever. <br><br><strong>Q: Was it an emotional experience for you when you medaled? </strong> <br><br>A: When I won my gold medal, it was overwhelming and amazing. I was actually so satisfied it scared me. I thought I was going to be the tough guy standing proudly on the podium, but as soon as the national anthem started playing in my honor, and in our country's honor, I bawled like a baby. <br><br><strong>Q: What advice would you give to young athletes? </strong> <br><br>A: I would tell them to believe in yourself. You're worth it. Put in the time and be honest about how hard you're working, and then have a plan for your success. Think about what are you going to do once you achieve it, and how you're going to pay it forward and make sure that you stay humble. <br><br><strong>Q: How rewarding for you is it to help others now after going through so many obstacles? </strong> <br><br>A: I went through so much throughout my career. I had several injuries, but most of the soft tissue injuries just made me angry and pushed me harder. The structural injury, which broke my femur, scared me a lot, but I learned so much about myself, what I'm capable of and that my strengths are really internal. I now get so much pleasure out of helping the next generation to do prehab to keep them on the slopes, to also check their equipment and ensure they're doing necessary cross-training. And when they do get injured, it's really satisfying to be able to talk to them, motivate them and help them through it.

With New Year's Eve on the horizon, Americans of all ages also are resolving to do more to improve their financial situation in 2014. When we asked about what was on their financial to-do list, most were making practical resolutions, with the top 5 resolutions cited as: <br><br>1. Reaching a savings goal <br>2. Saving and investing more <br>3. Having an up-to-date will <br>4. Maintaining an emergency fund <br>5. Getting a new job or a better job with higher pay <br><br>When it comes to setting resolutions, keep in mind that financial toughness is a marathon, not a sprint, so you don't have to tackle everything at once.

Especially during this season of giving, many of us make giving back with our families part of our holiday routine, whether it's volunteering at a local soup kitchen, or contributing canned goods to a food bank. This is good not only for your moral karma, but for more pragmatic reasons. December 31st is the end of the tax year and you and your family can start preparing for a generous tax deduction come April 2014. To help make the most impact both in your community and your wallet, here are some ideas no matter what your budget, courtesy of some of my giving heroes: <br><br>1. Do your giving while you're living, says <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/dressforsuccess\">Dress for Success Worldwide</a> CEO, <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/joi-gordon/2/3bb/3b7\">Joi Gordon</a>. \"I heard that at a conference and it really made an impact on me. Before then, I thought of 'philanthropy' as something the wealthy participate in and something that the rest of us might address in our wills, if we could afford it. This made me realize that my gift, no matter how small or how large, can go a long way to advance society.\" <br><br>2. Make a place for giving in your household budget, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/david-shapiro/3/b64/2b4\">David Shapiro</a>, CEO of <a href=\"https://www.mentoring.org/\">MENTOR: The National Mentoring Partnership</a>. \"Budget your giving based on a percentage of your income and distribute it amongst causes and issues that are important to you because you are confident the nonprofit leaders and programs you believe in will deliver the intended outcomes you desire. Sometimes it makes sense just to give because you are moved to give, and we have to be proportional about strategic versus emotional philanthropy.\" <br><br>3. Think local and support small is what <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/esther-stearns/a/949/a76\">Esther Stearns</a> believes. \"I prefer to give in areas where my contribution will make a visible impact. So I tend to give more locally and to smaller groups where my contribution makes a significant difference.\" <br><br>4. Put your money where your heart is, advises Joi. \"There are so many great causes, all throughout this world, that need our support, but I believe that giving should be personal. My goal is to make my giving portfolio a financial track record of the things that I care about, hope for and believe in.\" <br><br>5. Giving isn't just about money, says <a href=\"https://www.citibank.com/womenandco/article/why-i-give-heather-spohr.jsp?intcmpid=z5_article_whyigiveheatherspohr_r15\">Heather Spohr</a>, award-winning writer of the blog The Spohrs Are Multiplying, as well as the president of Friends Of Maddie , a charitable organization that supports the families of critically ill babies in Neonatal Intensive Care Units. \"Find an organization or cause that you're passionate about, and then figure out how you can best help. For some, this may be donating money, for others it might be by volunteering their time. Is there a unique skill you have that you can use to the benefit of your cause? Do it! I love using my social media skills to help the causes I'm most passionate about.\" <br><br>6. Think innovation, impact and outcomes, says <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/wendisturgis\">Wendi Sturgis</a>, EVP of Sales and Service at Yext. \"As someone who works at a start up, I approach my philanthropy investing in a similar fashion. I want to work with innovative, high-impact, outcome-oriented organizations. I always encourage people to understand what they are passionate about, since investing and giving has to feel personal. I also look for great leaders whom I believe in. Finally, I think it is important to support the organizations that have had an impact on your life, ala your alma mater, etc.\" <br><br>7. Don't just give, but invest, suggests <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/pub/angela-haines/9/807/a41\">Angela Haines</a>, Forbes blogger and founder of <a href=\"https://www.wstartup.com/\">wStartup.com</a>. \"I decided to set aside a portion of my assets for risk, and that is the portion I use to invest in very early start ups in companies headed by women. It's my small contribution to helping women advance in business, something I've been passionate about since my early days as a Fortune reporter. To me it's about helping these amazing women realize their dreams--and often impact society at the same time.\" <br><br>What are some of the ways you give back during the holidays?

She had been struggling with her reading skills, barely able to read a few words, but when the library's doors opened, Sirisha was captivated by the visual appeal of the environment and her love of books was instantly born. <br><br>Two years later, Sirisha makes sure she leaves home early each morning so that she has extra time to read a few stories in the library before class begins. With support from the school's head teacher, Sirisha is now an avid and skilled reader. Sirisha's parents, who are illiterate, are proud of their daughter's academic progress and enjoy listening to her read the stories she's borrowed from the library. \"The library is my best friend--I love spending time with all those books,\" Sirisha says. One of Room to Read's published children's titles, A Day in the Market, has special significance for Sirisha as it reminds her of the shopping trips she takes with her mother to buy vegetables. \"The day I could read it without faltering, I took the book home and read it aloud to her,\" she says proudly. <br><br>At Room to Read, we believe that World Change Starts with Educated Children and we have committed to focusing on two key areas where we can have the greatest impact: Literacy and Girls' Education. Since our founding in 2000, with the support of inspired investors, we have impacted nearly eight million children across Asia and Africa through our network of libraries and schools, local language children's books, teacher training and reading and writing instruction curriculums. To ensure our programs are successful and sustainable, we partner with communities and governments in our ten countries of operation. <br><br>Of the 774 million illiterate people in the world today, a staggering two-thirds are female. We continuously work to encourage awareness and action to turn the tide on illiteracy. Educating women and girls is widely acknowledged as a powerful and effective way to address global poverty--one extra year of education for a girl can earn her 20 percent more as an adult. In fact, the World Bank has stated that educating girls yields the highest rate of return than any other investment in the developing world. We agree. Our Girls' Education program supports girls to not only graduate secondary school, but develop the necessary skills--such as critical thinking, self-confidence and financial planning-- to make key life decisions. <br><br>We have all seen how the power of one voice calling for change, when multiplied across communities and geographies can swell into an indelible force that demands the world's attention. Room to Read is committed to amplifying the call for global literacy and gender equality and we are proud to be one of the beneficiaries in Citi Velocity's e for Education campaign. With the support of Citi Velocity traders, Room to Read can reach 10 million children by 2015, making their futures better and brighter and equipping the world with the next generation of leaders.","image":"638e3264a3c47c530c0a661a","year":"2013","publishDate":"December 01, 2013","type":"insights","title":"A Portfolio for Global Literacy","author.jobTitle":["Room to Read"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2013/-in-2011-when-sirisha","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"12","author.displayName":["Room to Read"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"In Latin America, Citi also received a total of seven regional sub-category awards and seventeen country awards in the Best Corporate/Institutional Internet Banks category and two country awards in the Best Consumer Internet Banks category","month":"11","year":"2013","publishDate":"November 27, 2013","siteId":"citigpa","type":"insights","title":"Citi is Recognized by Global Finance Magazine as \"Best Corporate/Institutional Internet Bank\" in Latin America for the Seventh Consecutive Year","category":"PRESS RELEASE","url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/press-release/2013/citi-is-recognied-by-global-finance-magaine-as-best-corporateinstitutional-internet-bank-in-latin-america-for-the-seventh-consecutive-year","tags":["Press Release Migration"]},{"summary":"Tel Aviv - Citi announced today it will continue to support the Milken Institute to improve and expand financial inclusion for underserved and unbanked populations in Israel.

I sat down with them recently to talk about the growth of their business and the importance of building a team from within the cities they serve. In these select excerpts from the interview, Kristen and Kristin share Revolution Foods' origins, their passion for food and the impact their company has had beyond the school lunchroom. Catch the Q&amp;A in its entirety on Monday, December 2nd, on Huffington Posts's <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/news/urban_progress/\">Urban Progress blog</a>, presented by Citi. <br><br><strong>Q: So tell us, how did you two meet? What's the story behind Revolution Foods? </strong> <br><br><em>Kristin Groos Richmond</em>: We met on the first day of business school and within our first year we started crafting the business plan for Revolution Foods. Both of us had a passion for food and nutrition, so we saw what an opportunity there was, both from an impact standpoint and from a business-building standpoint. <br><em><br>Kirsten Saenz Tobey</em>: We started seven-and-a-half years ago with very humble roots as most entrepreneurs do. Revolution Foods began with three schools, serving about 500 meals a day out of a 500-square-foot kitchen in Oakland, California. We hand-produced every meal -- we made our homemade turkey sandwiches, rolled our quesadillas, packed our fruit -- and delivered each one to schools every day in one truck that we leased. <br><br><strong>Q: I met you both as your business really began to expand, first to more schools and then to new product lines. What has that been like? </strong> <br><em><br>Kirsten Saenz Tobey</em>: From that original kitchen, we have now expanded to seven culinary centers around the country, and we are now serving over one million meals a week. It's a tremendous undertaking and a very complex operational business. It's also one that has allowed us to create more than 1,000 jobs in urban communities, which is one of the things that we treasure most about Revolution Foods. <br><br><em>Kristin Groos Richmond</em>: We knew early on that we wanted to have a large-scale impact and to provide as many families in America as possible access to high-quality food. That came first in the form of expanding to new geographic areas: serving more schools and more families through our school meals program. But very quickly we also realized that teachers and parents wanted to see our food on store shelves, so we recently launched our meal kits, which are now available nationwide. <br><strong><br>Q: Kirsten, you mentioned the pride you feel in creating jobs for your teammates. Tell us more about that. </strong> <br><br><em>Kirsten Saenz Tobey</em>: When we do town halls with our team, we always say we've done almost every job in the company and really respect the folks who are working at Revolution Foods in cities across the country. It feels good to have grown up with the idea, to have created it step-by-step, and most importantly to have built an incredible team to help us scale. One of the things we're most proud of is watching our teammates grow and turn jobs into careers. <br><br><em>Kristin Groos Richmond</em>: People come in for an interview because they're looking for a job, but then they join the company because they believe in what we're doing. They stay because they have opportunities to grow and to contribute. It's really the ability for someone to come in at an entry level and earn a sustainable income while gaining an ownership stake in the company, and then be managing a team of 20 people within four to five years with hard work, solid coaching, and great performance.","image":"638e3266a3c47c530c0a6623","year":"2013","publishDate":"November 22, 2013","type":"insights","title":"How Can Good Business Make America's Cities Healthier?","author.jobTitle":["Managing Director, Citi"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2013/how-can-good-business-make-americas-cities-healthier","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"11","author.displayName":["Mark Paris"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"Lima - The Citi Microentrepreneurship Awards are the flagship initiative of the Citi Foundation, emphasizing the importance of micro-entrepreneurship and microfinance in financial inclusion processes and the socio-economic empowerment of low-income individuals.

We started small, opening North Star Academy Charter School with 72 fifth-grade students in Newark in 1997. Two years later, Roxbury Preparatory Charter School in Boston welcomed its first class of sixth-graders. This fall, nearly 10,000 students entered our classrooms in our 38 schools across five cities: Boston, Newark, New York City, Rochester, and Troy. We have grown dramatically since those first years - Uncommon is now larger than 94% of public school districts nationwide and is one of the largest charter management organizations in the country. <br><br>But growth is only positive if it means more kids are getting access to an outstanding education - which is why I am so proud to say that Uncommon is proving it IS possible to run great schools at scale. This fall, CREDO - an independent research organization at Stanford - released a study highlighting Uncommon as proof that the achievement gap can be closed, finding specifically that: <br><br>• Uncommon low-income students performed so well in math and reading that the effects of being at an Uncommon school \"completely cancel out the negative effect associated with being a student in poverty.\" <br>• Low-income students who attend an Uncommon school on average grow as much or more than their non-low-income peers attending traditional public schools. <br>• In math, students of color who attend an Uncommon school had on average more significant academic growth than white students at traditional public schools. <br>• Our special education students experienced academic growth almost as strong as general education students in traditional public schools. <br><br>These results are a reflection of the incredibly hard work our scholars and their teachers do every day in every Uncommon school. We felt grateful to be honored for this hard work this summer when we received the 2013 Broad Prize for Public Charter Schools, which recognizes \"the public charter management organization that has demonstrated the most outstanding overall student performance and improvement in the nation in recent years while reducing achievement gaps for low-income students and students of color.\" <br><br>Just as importantly, Uncommon is demonstrating the financial viability of our efforts. Every one of our schools is designed to operate on public per-pupil funding once it reaches full enrollment. Today, 24 of our 38 schools are operating on public funding alone, with another seven slated to achieve financial sustainability next year. As a result of this disciplined financial management, we are able to leverage and target our philanthropic dollars strategically. Citi's support and other private donations help fund each school's start-up years, the purchase of new buildings as we expand, and allow us to pursue special initiatives as we tackle our biggest challenges, such as supporting, developing, and retaining our exceptional teachers. <br><br>I'm extraordinarily proud to be a part of this movement, and I'm grateful every day for the intelligence, creativity, and commitment of my colleagues. We look forward to growing our impact over the coming years, eventually serving over 16,000 students as our current schools grow to full enrollment and we open additional new schools, We'll continue to think about how to share what we've learned with others but also continue to ask ourselves how we can get better at our work, because we know that the work of serving students and families is as difficult as it is important, and there is always room for growth. That's why I'm so grateful for the generosity of partners like Citi. Support from 'e for education' will help us continue to provide life-changing educational opportunities to children across the Northeast.","image":"638e3267a3c47c530c0a662c","year":"2013","publishDate":"November 19, 2013","type":"insights","title":"Uncommon Schools: Redefining Urban Public Education","author.jobTitle":["CEO, Uncommon Schools"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2013/uncommon-schools-redefining-urban-public-education","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"11","author.displayName":["Brett Peiser"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"Prague - The Citi Foundation and Tereza Maxová Foundation launched a pilot project aimed at improving financial literacy among mothers and women living in shelters in the Czech Republic this summer.

We believe that inspirational teaching and leadership can transform a child's life opportunities. <br><br>When people in the developed world think about people living in poverty, the images that come to mind aren't often of the communities that surround us. Yet in Britain today, 3.5 million children are growing up in households so poor that providing basics such as heating and food is a daily struggle. Children growing up in poverty can all too often become trapped in a downward spiral of low educational achievement, inferior job opportunities and greatly increased chances of drug use, poor health and involvement with crime. In some areas they will even die sooner than their wealthier neighbour. <br><br>The gap in educational achievement is wider in the UK that in almost any other developed country, and the cost to the country is grave. <br><br>• The reading skills of children from disadvantaged families are, on average, more than two years behind those of pupils from wealthier backgrounds, a gap twice as wide as most other developed countries. <br><br>• 1 in 6 young people leave school unable to read, write and add up properly. <br><br>• Just 16% of youngsters eligible for free schools meals progress to university, compared in 96% of young people educated in independent schools. <br><br>• The UK's economy will see cumulative losses of up to £1.3 trillion over the next 40 years if we fail to bring the educational outcomes of children from poorer homes up to the UK average. <br><br>At Teach First, we recruit dynamic, passionate graduates and career-changers to teach in schools in low-income communities. We select only those who demonstrate leadership potential, a passion to change children's lives and the other skills and attributes needed to become an excellent teacher and leader. <br><br>These participants teach and lead in our partner primary and secondary schools in low-income communities across England and Wales. We only work with schools where more than half the pupils come from the poorest homes. Only 4% of newly qualified teachers would consider working in these schools, but all of our teachers commit to working there for a minimum of two years, ensuring that every child has access to an excellent education. <br><br>Since 2002, we have trained more than 4,500 teachers to work at more than 500 schools in low-income communities. We are building a movement of leaders who will change the education system, eradicating educational disadvantage and making a meaningful impact on children, their families and communities. <br><br>But there is still so much to be done. There are still more than 4,000 schools in the UK that are eligible to work with Teach First that we are not yet partnered with. By 2015, we want to recruit, train and place 2,000 new teachers every year to work in the schools that need them the most. <a href=\"https://www.citivelocity.com/equity/public/charity/index.jsp\">Citi Velocity</a> can help us to reach this ambitious target, reaching out to more passionate and determined individuals who can make life-changing impact in classrooms across the country. <br><br>Our mission to end educational inequality drives everything we do - it's an ambitious goal and we know we cannot achieve it alone. So we work in partnership with schools, charities, businesses and individuals who want to ensure that every young person can succeed in life. We nurture and champion innovative approaches to education, initiate conversations and influence decision makers to bring about change. We run projects to increase young people's confidence and participation in important decisions about their future, including access to higher education. Citi Velocity and E for Education will help us to expand and accelerate our impact and change more children's lives.","image":"638e326aa3c47c530c0a6639","year":"2013","publishDate":"November 12, 2013","type":"insights","title":"Teach First: Inspirational Leaders Transforming Children's Lives","author.jobTitle":["CEO/Founder, Teach First"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2013/teach-first-inspirational-leaders-transforming-childrens-lives","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"11","author.displayName":["Brett Wigdortz"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"On November 6, <a href=\"https://veteransonwallstreet.com/\">Veterans on Wall Street</a>, a consortium of large financial institutions including Citi, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs, was the presenting sponsor of the <a href=\"https://bobwoodrufffoundation.org/sufh/\">Stand up for Heroes</a> concert in New York City to benefit the <a href=\"https://bobwoodrufffoundation.org/\">Bob Woodruff Foundation</a>.

It helps to ensure young people can find jobs, be engaged in their communities, and become productive members of society. Sixty-five low and middle income countries lose approximately $92 billion annually by failing to educate girls to the same standard as boys. <a href=\"https://www.empowerweb.org/\"> EMpower</a>-The Emerging Markets Foundation- was founded with the mission to help such youth achieve their educational potential. We work exclusively in Emerging Market (EM) countries, partnering with locally-led organizations that share our mission of empowering at-risk young people between the ages of 10-24. Rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, we support relevant education strategies that address specific needs in different countries and communities, and are based on best practices in youth development. <br><br>Education is the largest of EMpower's four investment portfolios. We make strategic contributions in EM countries experiencing a huge bulge in the population of young people (nearly 1 billion youth in the 14 countries where we work), and widening inequalities in education, health, income and opportunity. Through these investments, we work with local grantee partners to grow, develop and, most importantly, transform, the lives of youth in their communities. And we have staying power: we are willing to fund organizations that demonstrate results for up to 10 years, an industry best practice. <br><br>Two nations where we've seen our commitments have measureable impact are South Africa and India. In South Africa, where the apartheid legacy has not erased yawning gaps and the quality of math and science education is substandard (South Africa ranked 137 out of 139 countries), EMpower is investing in 'second chance' programs that level the playing field. After-school and Saturday tutoring programs and math and science intensives for girls are just a few of the initiatives we've help put in place. Education-focused grantees include Ikamva Youth, Future of the African Daughter, Equal Education, Wilderness Foundation, Etafeni Trust. <br><br>In India, education is compulsory and free through grade 8. However, schools then experience high drop-out rates, especially among girls. We are investing in programs to keep girls in school through covering fees and uniforms, conducting outreach to mitigate parents' concerns about their daughters' safety and marriageability, and ensuring a high quality of education so it is seen as value-add not an opportunity cost. Education-focused grantees include Vidhayak Sansad, Lend a Hand India, Ibtada, Parivaar Education Society, Nishtha. See more <a href=\"https://www.empowerweb.org/global-reach/global-grantee-projects/\">examples</a> of our work across the world. <br><br>We believe young people are a critical, untapped resource in every country. To ensure they have bright futures, EMpower remains committed to finding and funding the most promising, innovative and scalable models to help educate them and impart 21st century skills (computer literacy, English, etc.). <br><br>","image":"638e326da3c47c530c0a664b","year":"2013","publishDate":"November 05, 2013","type":"insights","title":"EMpower: Ensuring At-Risk Youth Have a Better Tomorrow","author.jobTitle":["President, EMpower"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2013/empower-ensuring-at-risk-youth-have-a-better-tomorrow","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"11","author.displayName":["Marta Cabrera"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"New York - The Asset Building Policy Network (ABPN), a coalition of the nation's leading advocacy, policy and civil rights organizations and Citi, has launched five new groundbreaking asset-building programs funded by the Citi Foundation and designed to build pathways to long-term economic security and expand equal opportunity for low- and moderate-income (LMI) communities of color.","month":"11","year":"2013","publishDate":"November 04, 2013","siteId":"citigpa","type":"insights","title":"Asset Building Policy Network Launches New Programs to Reduce Wealth Gap in U.S.","category":"PRESS RELEASE","url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/foundation/news/press-release/2013/asset-building-policy-network-launches-new-programs-to-reduce-wealth-gap-in-us","tags":["Press Release Migration","Environmental, Social & Governance"]},{"summary":"Miami, Florida - Citi has been named \"Best Regional Derivatives Provider in Latin America\" by <i>Global Finance</i> magazine, for the third consecutive year, as part of the ninth annual \"World's Best Derivatives Providers\" awards for 2013.

Using the year 2020 as a focal point for action, FI2020 aims to mobilize stakeholders around the world to work collaboratively towards full financial inclusion, which CFI defines as \"a state in which everyone who can use them has access to a full suite of quality financial services, provided at affordable prices, in a convenient manner, with respect and dignity.\" <br><br>Since January, working groups have been mapping the so-called \"<a href=\"https://www.centerforfinancialinclusion.org/fi2020/mapping-the-invisible-market\">invisible market</a>\" to better understand the broad demographic changes occurring at the base of the global economic pyramid. Others are developing the \"<a href=\"https://www.centerforfinancialinclusion.org/fi2020/roadmap-to-inclusion\">Roadmap to Inclusion</a>,\" an action-oriented blueprint for reaching new and underserved markets and for achieving a financially inclusive world. Together, we'll address issues of financial literacy, data analytics, technology-enabled business models, and more. <br><br>Citi's commitment to the years-long push behind this ambitious goal is the latest example of its work with key partners, including Accion, to expand financial inclusion. We have been working with Citi for nearly 50 years, starting in 1965 when Accion was a small non-profit focused on community development in Latin America. Together, over several decades, we've helped build microfinance institutions around the world, created financial education programs, and fueled research and thought-leadership activities. Over time, our ambition and scale have grown, but our partnership endures. <br><br>Whether in the developed world or in the developing world, Citi and Accion share the view that access to basic financial services can unlock enormous opportunity. We all need a safe place to save, access to credit to manage large purchases, go to school or build a business, insurance and efficient payment mechanisms. <br><br>Accion has worked with Citi Microfinance in a number of countries supporting Accion member institutions to reduce foreign exchange risk, to access local currency funding, in investing jointly in the Microfinance Growth Fund and in establishing Accion Microfinance Bank, the leading microfinance institution in Nigeria. In very challenging environments from Latin America to Africa and elsewhere, Accion and Citi have helped advance a global microfinance industry that is making progress in meeting enormous needs. <br><br>Citi continues to support research, innovations, institutions, intermediaries and networks that expand financial inclusion by combining access with education, while achieving scale and sustainability. As a result of a strategic, high-impact engagement over decades, Citi helps drive a global conversation on financial inclusion from every angle. <br><br>Over the last few decades, microfinance has grown to reach more than 200 million people around the world. This is very impressive - yet there is much more to do. Today, 2.5 billion people live in poverty and lack access to financial services. We can change that. We can build a financial system that includes those who are left out. We are very proud to be a very long-term partner with Citi.

From the bustling streets of New York City to the tranquil Karura Forest in Nairobi to classrooms in Manila, Citi employees convened with a common purpose of giving back and effecting change in their communities. In fact, this year's Global Community Day <a href=\"https://www.citifoundation.com/citi/foundation/pdf/gcd_13_infographic.pdf\">results</a> reinforce Citi's year-round commitment to improving local communities around the world. <br><br>As one of the people who manages Citi's year-round global volunteer efforts, I'm fortunate to work with more than 800 Citi volunteer coordinators as well as countless senior business leaders who together recognize the value in dedicating time, energy, and resources to Global Community Day every year. The event requires months of planning and preparation, but it is an exercise with rewards that are plain to see the minute we put on our Citi t-shirts and get to work. <br><br>This year I spent the day volunteering at Ruppert Park, on the East Side of Manhattan, where more than 60 of my colleagues worked side-by-side landscaping and repainting playground equipment. Throughout the day, passersby of all ages, many taken aback by the fact that we were spending a sunny Saturday working our tails off, thanked us for our efforts. That gratitude is appreciated, but the real reward of Global Community Day is the satisfaction that comes from knowing that we were part of something bigger - a truly global effort to make a positive impact on neighborhoods around the world. <br><br>One final point: Global Community Day could never happen without the support and enthusiasm of our community partners. These are the organizations that help pinpoint local needs and work with us to develop projects that maximize our impact. This is best exemplified by the 6,000+ Citi employees who participated in skills-based volunteering, including providing pro-bono legal services to aspiring microentrepreneurs, building the financial capability of low-income families, and assisting young people with developing their job skills. <br><br>If you're curious to see what 325,000 hours of service look like, check out Citi's <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/citi\">Facebook page</a> or follow the conversation on Twitter at #CitiVolunteers.","image":"638e32a3a3c47c530c0a6791","year":"2013","publishDate":"June 28, 2013","type":"insights","title":"66,000 Citi Volunteers in 473 Cities Connect With Each Other and Their Communities","author.jobTitle":["Chief Operating Officer"],"url":"/global/news/perspective/2013/66000-citi-volunteers-in-473-cities-connect-with-eachother-and-heir-communities","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"06","author.displayName":["Florencia Spangaro"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"In connection with Global Community Day this past weekend, Citi employees are sharing their stories on volunteerism and how they've made an impact in their local communities.

In honor of this continued service, Citi Volunteers are sharing their stories of commitment to improving their local communities. <br><br>Molly Chen, a Citi volunteer and employee in the Public Sector Group of Citi China, shares her unique story in the Q&amp;A below. Molly's service has helped children of migrant workers in a local Chinese vocational school learn basic English and improve their financial literacy. <br><br><strong>What organization did you work with on Global Community Day last year and what work did you do with them? </strong> <br><br>Last year, I helped support a local vocational school. The event was magnificent and well-received both by the students and Citi volunteers. I felt honored to have coordinated the baking group and hosted the celebration party. Students from this school are migrant youth from low-income families, who often find themselves isolated from urban life. Therefore, our interactions with them helped expand their worldview and fostered a sense of positivity in their daily life. <br><br>We taught them basic English language skills as well as financial literacy. The latter is especially important for these youth as they're rarely exposed to financial education and are not aware of the importance of forming healthy financial habits. <br><br><strong>How did the volunteering you did alongside the organization you worked with contribute to improving the community? </strong> <br><br>All of the students are children of migrant workers. Migrant workers typically are underprivileged, making it difficult to provide for their children. Through the Global Community Day event with the vocational school, we strengthened the relationship between Citi and the community, provided financial support to the school and the students, and also stimulated the students' interests in personal finance. <br><br><strong>What are you most proud of from your volunteering experience? </strong> <br><br>Helping others brings the feeling of happiness. For me, watching the big and sincere smiles on students' faces is the most rewarding part of volunteering. <br><br><strong>In what ways do you think volunteering makes a difference? </strong> <br><br>Volunteering is beneficial to individuals and the community, as a whole. Showing care and compassion for others contributes to a healthier, more prosperous community. <br><br><strong>What organization did you volunteer with this on this year's Global Community Day? </strong> <br><br>This year, I chose to once again volunteer at an event in support of the economic and social development of young people, specifically migrant youth. <br><br>To learn more about Citi's Global Community Day 2013, visit the <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/citi\">Citi Facebook Page</a> or follow the conversation on twitter by searching <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23CitiVolunteers&amp;src=tyah\">#CitiVolunteers </a>","image":"638e32a8a3c47c530c0a67ad","year":"2013","publishDate":"June 24, 2013","type":"insights","title":"Reflecting on Service: Molly Chen Shares Experience Helping Children of Migrant Workers","author.jobTitle":["Citi"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2013/reflecting-on-service-molly-chen-shares-experience-helping-children-of-migrant-workers","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"06","author.displayName":["Molly Chen"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"New York - Citi employees, alumni, family and friends around the world will reinforce the company's commitment to supporting and improving communities by turning out in force today during Citi's eighth annual Global Community Day.

In addition to allowing someone to be a homeowner, the new homes help to improve the neighborhood's economic growth <br><br><strong>• What was the most rewarding part of your experience volunteering with Habitat last year? </strong> <br><br>Habitat requires future homeowners to work a set number of hours on their new home alongside volunteers. Working with the homeowner was very gratifying as I could immediately see the positive impact my efforts made. <br><br><strong>• What are you most proud of from your volunteering experience? </strong> <br><br>I'm proud that I am able to help others. It's as simple as that. There are so many underprivileged people. Whether it be financially, socially, physically... the reason is irrelevant. I feel blessed in my life with what I have. I feel that the least that I can do is to help others as much as possible so they feel blessed and live a life they always wanted to have. <br><strong><br>• What advice would you give to someone who wanted to start volunteering in their community? </strong> <br><br>Find something you are passionate about, whether it be children, families, people with disabilities, community clean-up, etc. There is no wrong answer. There are few things in life that give you immediate gratification. I've yet to volunteer and walk away without a smile and knowing I made a difference. <br><br><strong>• In what ways do you think volunteering makes a difference? </strong> <br><br>Knowing that you've touched someone else's life makes a big difference. It can be small or big. Every time you volunteer, someone will notice. Helping build a house through Habitat for Humanity makes a person that much closer to having a home and you can say without doubt you helped make that happen. <br><br>Interested in volunteering for Habitat for Humanity?

One important partner that Citi works with is Young Enterprise, the UK affiliate of Junior Achievement Worldwide. Young Enterprise focuses on teaching financial literacy for students and inspiring young people to achieve through enterprise. <br><br>To learn more about Citi's collaboration with Young Enterprise, read the Q&amp;A below with Rosalind Groves, a volunteer and Product Manager within Treasury and Trade Solutions EMEA at Citi in London, as she shares her experience working with the organization: <br><br><strong><br>What work did you do with Young Enterprise on Global Community Day least year? </strong> <br><br>Last year I taught in a Primary School in Hampstead, North West London, alongside 12 other Citi Volunteers. Our product team was placed together in a class of twenty 8-year-old children to run the lessons for the day. We introduced them to the different industries in the UK and the supply chains within those industries; e.g. how apples get from the orchards in rural England to the supermarkets in London via the apple market, the factory, the warehouse, distribution etc. <br><br><strong>How does volunteering with Young Enterprise contribute to improving the community? </strong> <br><br>Young Enterprise brings a new dimension into the academic schooling environment. As a charity, they argue that an excessively narrow focus on academic skills and exams can fail to give students the employability they need. Through this type of volunteering - bringing those in banking into a school - we help to ensure that the children in a community start to develop skills that will help make them more employable one day - skills such as teamwork, practical thinking and business-like behavior. <br><br><strong>What was the most rewarding part of your work last year? </strong> <br><br>Watching the children engage with everyday life and begin to realize and learn how some things from their day-to-day lives actually work! Many of them heard their parents talking about paying taxes, but they'd never realized the link between taxation and public spending - so they left school that day understanding some of the dynamics of our national economy - e.g. understanding how tax funds can result in the street lamps being lit at night, bins being emptied and the police protecting us. <br><br><strong>What are you most proud of from your volunteering experience? </strong> <br><br>Having completed Young Enterprise's Company Programme myself at school, I have seen the true value of this charity and so I'm proud to be able to pass something on to younger people, because someone else took the time to do that for me. <br><br><strong>What organization are you volunteering with this year for Global Community Day? </strong> <br><br>Young Enterprise, again!

One of our key partners is Habitat for Humanity. Below, Mike Carscaddon, executive vice president of international field operations at Habitat for Humanity International, talks about the organization's work and partnership with Citi and the Citi Foundation. </em> <br><strong><br>Building Communities across the Globe </strong> <br><br>Habitat for Humanity International has built, rehabilitated, repaired or improved more than 600,000 houses worldwide, providing decent and affordable shelter for more than 3 million people. Recently Builder Magazine named Habitat as the tenth largest homebuilder in the United States. <br><br>Since 1999, Citi and the Citi Foundation have helped advance Habitat's mission to build homes, communities and hope by providing technical, financial and volunteer support to expand our programs as well as test new ideas. <br><br>In 2004, the Citi Foundation and Habitat began working together to provide a number of services to families in need of adequate shelter. Starting in Latin America, we focused on developing a financial education program that would deliver high-quality training to families who had either applied for or who had been approved as recipients of loans to purchase or improve their homes. Over the past nine years, Habitat has helped improve the financial stability of partner families by providing financial education workshops and customized financial counseling to 15,000 families through its affiliates and microfinance partners in 11 countries. <br><br>Citi and the Citi Foundation continues to help Habitat work with market actors, such as local financial institutions, to develop financial products appropriate for the incremental building process pursued by much of the developing world. Through Habitat's influence, now more than 50 local financial institutions offer housing microfinance - a bundle of financial services and construction technical assistance - sustainably serving households through demand-driven market systems. A recent example is in the Asia Pacific region where, with Citi Foundation support, we are currently implementing a multi-country microsavings and financial education initiative designed to help low-income families living in disaster-prone areas save for home improvements. <br><br>This work culminated in Habitat's creation of its Center for Innovation in Shelter and Finance (CISF), which is our main initiative to influence market actors to engage in and use best practices to expand access to affordable housing through the market. Citi Foundation's support of the Center's publication \"Housing Microfinance: A Product Development Toolkit\" led to the highest-attended training at the 2012 SEEP annual meetings. <br><br>Below are three ways our approach has helped build communities across the globe: <br><br><strong>1. Strong communities through decent housing </strong> <br><br>In the United States, more than 200 affiliates are engaged in Habitat's Neighborhood Revitalization Initiative, which constructs, repairs and rehabilitates affordable housing with low-income families in markets hit hard by foreclosures. Habitat affiliates are joining residents, nonprofits, businesses, local governments and communities of faith to create and implement a shared vision of revitalization. After Habitat helped revitalize a Winston-Salem, N.C., neighborhood, by working with a host of local public and private partners, crime dropped by 50 percent and drug offenses by 70 percent. <br><strong><br>2. Improved local economies </strong> <br><br>Habitat's local construction efforts positively affect local economies. A study in Dallas, Texas, for example, indicates that for every dollar Dallas Area Habitat for Humanity spends, $3.18 is generated in economic activity. A Habitat development in New York channeled $2 million to local businesses over the course of a project there, and a study by the Center for Business and Economic Research at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville reveals that during fiscal year 2011, each Habitat home built in Tennessee generated 6.24 full-time jobs. <br><br><strong>3. Vibrant market-oriented access </strong> <br><br>Habitat's efforts such as the CISF above have worked to expand opportunities for affordable housing through the market beyond what can be provided through non-profits alone. Citi volunteer support on Habitat for Humanity International's social investment fund for housing in the developing world, the MicroBuild fund, has approved more than $20 million in capital to be used for the construction of homes by low-income households in Tajikistan, Uganda, Lebanon, and Bolivia. <br><br>Finally, Habitat for Humanity could not have built its first house, let alone more than 600,000, without support from partners at so many levels, creating lasting partner relationships and networks. Corporate donors and volunteers working hand in hand with families create a meaningful experience for all, and many times lasting bonds emerge. We are pleased that Citi volunteers from across the world - including in the Dominican Republic, Jordan, Canada and the U.S - will be volunteering their time with Habitat programs this month. <br><br>Visit <a href=\"https://www.habitat.org/getinv\">www.habitat.org/getinv</a> to learn about Habitat's work around the world and how you can get involved.","image":"638e32aea3c47c530c0a67cf","year":"2013","publishDate":"June 19, 2013","type":"insights","title":"Building Communities Across the Globe with Habitat for Humanity","author.jobTitle":["Executive Vice President of International Field Operations, Habitat for Humanity International"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2013/building-communities-across-the-globe-with-habitat-for-humanity","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"06","author.displayName":["Mike Carscaddon"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"New York - More small-business owners say business conditions are good or excellent today than at any point in years, according to the latest Citibank® Small Business Pulse released today.

We strive to make a positive impact on society and live up to our responsibility to serve the communities where we do business. To me, there is no greater way to build a stronger sense of pride in the company we work for than to volunteer. It provides creative opportunities for professional development, deepens relationships with strategic partners, and most importantly, makes a difference in the lives of others. <br><br>While Citi employees volunteer year-round, Global Community Day (GCD), which will be held this year on June 22nd, is an annual company-wide event that unites tens of thousands of Citi employees, friends and families, in community-building efforts in countries around the world. We organize major volunteer opportunities for GCD and leverage our employees' unique skills and expertise to support local nonprofits. It's an opportunity for people to come together and demonstrate their passion for service. This year my colleagues across the world have already planned more than 1,200 events across 90 countries (and counting). <br><br>For the month of June, Citi will be featuring stories on volunteerism and the impact that Global Community Day has on the local community. To kick us off, I'd like to share how volunteering has impacted my life and why I believe it's important to serve others. <br><br><strong>Why I volunteer. </strong>I strongly believe in the ideal of an active citizen and feel that we all have a responsibility to help people and support a clean and healthy environment on which we all depend. Throughout my life, volunteering has helped me develop my skills as a leader while providing me the satisfaction of advancing causes I deeply believe in. And it has added meaning to my life. Even though it may seem like there's not enough time in the day, there are lots of ways that volunteering can fit into your life. I started out volunteering in my local neighborhood of East Harlem here in New York City. Today I volunteer my time as Chair of the Board at Johns Hopkins University as well as the board of the Long Island Chapter of the Nature Conservancy. <br><br><strong>Why it matters.</strong> I have seen Citi volunteers benefit communities and impact the lives of others. I have also been part of those efforts. We recently hosted a series of <a href=\"https://www.taprootfoundation.org/about-probono/blog/start-small-think-big-citi-scales-skills-marathon-model-pilot-global-initiative\">skills-based volunteer marathons</a> where volunteers were paired with nonprofit organizations to tackle a specific time sensitive organizational need in a one-day setting. This capacity building effort enabled organizations to improve their performance and better serve their clients. But even non skills-based volunteer activities have a tremendous impact. Last year on GCD, a large number of Citi volunteers helped put together comfort kits for the American Red Cross to use in emergencies. One group stuffed teddy bears for children. It wasn't a technically challenging task, but because of their work, the volunteers helped many children in dire circumstances feel comforted and secure. <br><br><strong>Why you should try it.</strong> Volunteering is a way to make a difference while also enhancing your personal and professional skills. You definitely get back as much as you give. And, if you're lucky, you might have an experience that changes your life. <br><br>This is my story and I encourage you to continue to read our blog throughout the month of June for updates and other stories on how Citi's partners and employees are building their communities through volunteering around the world.","image":"638e32b8a3c47c530c0a6809","year":"2013","publishDate":"June 10, 2013","type":"insights","title":"Building Communities through Volunteering: Reflection on Global Community Day","author.jobTitle":["CEO and President, the Citi Foundation and Director, Corporate Citizenship"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2013/building-communities-through-volunteering--reflection-on-global-community-day","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"06","author.displayName":["Pam Flaherty"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"Manama, Bahrain - Citi Bahrain and the Bahrain Association of Banks (BAB) recently organized a 'Women in Banking' roundtable that determined that there is a need to establish a forum to support and empower women working in Bahrain's banking and financial sector.

We employ a variety of strategies, from confronting poachers in the field, to protecting important habitats, to working with governments to enact smart policies. During the past decade, we've been focused on an increasingly important track: engagement with the world's biggest companies and financial institutions to enhance our efforts. <br><br>• <strong>Our Work with Companies: </strong> <br>Much of WWFs work with the private sector focuses on strategic food and fiber sectors whose production and trade can threaten biodiversity and ecosystem services globally. We work with producers to demonstrate the <a href=\"https://worldwildlife.org/publications/profitability-and-sustainability-in-palm-oil-production\">business case for more sustainable production</a>, and we work with multi-stakeholder groups to develop sustainability standards, such as the <a href=\"https://www.rspo.org/\">Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil</a>, that can shift production practices at scale. Another example is WWF's <a href=\"https://gftn.panda.org/\">Global Forest &amp; Trade Network </a>that provides sustainability guidance to forestry companies and those purchasing and financing forest products. As our partner, Citigroup has been an active member of the GFTN North America advisory board for the past six years in support of this work. <br><br><strong>• Our Work with Financial Institutions: </strong> <br>As a complement to our work within supply chains of key food and fiber commodities, WWF has a <a href=\"https://worldwildlife.org/finance\">growing program with banks</a>, funds, asset managers and institutional investors globally. We see finance as a way of \"getting to scale,\" by encouraging investors and banks to adopt and implement sustainability conditions in their lending and investment decisions.

WWF has seen shared value in working with Citigroup and the <a href=\"https://bbop.forest-trends.org/\">Business and Biodiversity Offset Program</a> in the delivery of our <a href=\"https://www.equator-principles.com/index.php/best-practice-resources/b4b\">Biodiversity for Banks</a> program to more than 100 sustainability staff from 50 financial institutions globally over the past 18 months.

Here's some additional context to the story. <br><br>Citi has been a strong supporter of financial reform--not just Dodd-Frank Act but also Basel III's higher capital requirements and a range of other issues. Yet, as with any effort to address complex issues, some ideas clearly miss the mark. <br><br>Case in point: Section 716 of Dodd-Frank, or the \"swaps push-out\" provision, requires financial institutions to push most derivatives transactions out of the bank into a separate entity. This provision does absolutely nothing to create a safer financial system. In fact, Section 716 would negatively impact U.S. companies, financial firms, and their counterparties, while actually increasing systemic risk. This provision would create undue costs and burdens on U.S. financial firms. Swaps and other instruments covered by this rule are legitimate financial tools that are useful to a variety of companies in a range of circumstances. 716 won't make them go away. Rather, those companies that need to use these services will simply do business elsewhere, hurting U.S. competitiveness, and often pushing that business into less regulated corners of the financial system. <br><br>Everyone from Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke to former House Financial Services Chairman Barney Frank, the bill's namesake, has expressed concerns over the potential consequences of Section 716. Rarely do we see such bipartisan consensus across Congress, financial regulators, and the financial industry--and not just here in the U.S., but also amongst foreign banks that have significant U.S. operations. <br><br>Citi has taken on a lead role in working with our peers and Members of Congress to find a common sense solution. The result of this collaboration is legislation outlining a more straightforward and simplified approach to derivatives transactions--one that would not force swaps into lesser regulated entities. <br><br>Moreover, this new bill has received widespread bipartisan backing. Earlier this month in the House Financial Services Committee, the legislation garnered an overwhelming, bipartisan vote of support, 53 to 6. Efforts to modify Section 716 are a great example of how the industry and Congress can work together to find common ground toward our shared goal of strengthening the financial system.","image":"638e32c2a3c47c530c0a683b","year":"2013","publishDate":"May 24, 2013","type":"insights","title":"Strengthening Financial Reform","author.jobTitle":["Executive Vice President | Enterprise Services and Public Affairs"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2013/strengthening-financial-reform","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"05","author.displayName":["Ed Skyler"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"New York - Michael Corbat, Chief Executive Officer of Citigroup, will present at the Sanford C.

After all, retirement-account withdrawals are typically taxed as ordinary income, which can mean paying a federal rate as high as 39.6% in 2013. By contrast, in a taxable account, any qualifying dividends and long-term capital gains are taxed at a maximum federal rate of 20%. <br><br>What to do? If you're eligible, you can always fund a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k) instead. Roth accounts don't offer an initial tax deduction, but withdrawals can be federal and state tax-free if you follow the rules. <br><br>But even if the Roth isn't an option, a tax-deductible IRA or 401(k) remains a fine choice. That's because the initial tax deduction often pays for the eventual tax bill. <br><br>To understand why, consider a simple example. Suppose you are in the 25% federal income-tax bracket today--and you're still in the 25% bracket once you retire. If you put $1,000 in a tax-deductible IRA, your out-of-pocket cost would be $750, thanks to the $250 tax savings. <br><br>By the time you retire, let's assume your IRA has grown a hypothetical 100% to $2,000 (though there are, of course, no guarantees). At that juncture, you cash out the account, paying 25% to the government. That leaves you with $1,500, or 100% more than your $750 investment. In effect, the IRA gave you tax-free growth on your initial $750 out-of-pocket cost. <br><br>To be sure, if you are in a higher tax bracket in retirement, you won't enjoy totally tax-free growth. On the other hand, if your tax bracket falls in retirement--which often happens--you will benefit at Uncle Sam's expense.","image":"638e32c8a3c47c530c0a685d","year":"2013","publishDate":"May 17, 2013","type":"insights","title":"Retirement Accounts: Should You Fear the Eventual Tax Bill?","author.jobTitle":["Director of Financial Education, Citi Personal Wealth Management"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2013/retirement-accounts-should-you-fear-the-eventual-tax-bill","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"05","author.displayName":["Jonathan Clements"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"New York - Citigroup Inc.

Citi recently helped finance EDF Renewable Energy's Pacific Wind project located in Kern County, California, which achieved commercial operation in 2012 and can supply the electricity needs of 54,000 households. In addition, the Pacific Wind Project encompasses approximately 8,500 acres of leased land, but less than 2 percent of the land area will be occupied by wind turbines, allowing the balance to remain largely undisturbed. <br><br><strong>2) Wind energy helps offset other, more polluting sources of energy.</strong> When we use our wind farms to generate electricity, we provide long-term fixed pricing in an environment where pricing is constantly increasing, while also reducing CO2 emissions, the leading greenhouse gas. In fact, the Pacific Wind project helps avoid emissions of 165,866 Metric Tons of CO2 annually. <br><strong><br>3) Wind energy provides economic benefits to local communities.</strong> Jobs in manufacturing, construction, and wind farm operations are created as a result of wind energy project developments Landowners enjoy an additional income stream and local communities reap benefits from resulting tax revenues. As an example, the Pacific Wind project created approximately 250 jobs while under construction. <br><br>Environmental sustainability is a key issue for businesses, their clients, and the communities they operate in.

We then focus on implementing these green solutions into the Citi office environment, our homes and if possible, the broader community in which we live in. Our motto is \"One Citi... One Planet\" and we are committed to creating a sustainable future through the 3 \"R's\"- Reduce, Re-use, Recycle. <br><br>Below are three ways that the Citi Green Team in South Africa works toward the Citi motto and demonstrates commitment to sustainability: <br><br>1) <strong>We are a voluntary community</strong> - We think it is important that our members feel they part of a team, that we can make a difference and that the community is open to sharing ideas and driving the initiatives forward based on each person's unique skills and ability. It is also key that members are free to voluntarily contribute based on their own time and resources. Finally, we endeavor to make these initiatives fun and rewarding, knowing at the same time we are a part of the solution to the challenges we face. Our goal is to leave Citi and our planet greener and more sustainable for present and future generations. <br><br>2) <strong>We are action oriented</strong> - We think it is vital to talk about going green, as well a stake action on our ideas. Our key focus has been working with various Citi South Africa/Citi EMEA and even global divisions to activate sustainable ideas and improve existing initiatives. We believe this makes a big impact. We then apply the successes we achieve in the office to our homes and communities, to enable further sustainability through changed behaviors and new habits. The team motto is: every small step matters; we have to start taking action today. Going green is not a project, but a culture and habit we have to practice daily. We must also teach our children to do the same. <br><br>3) <strong>We focus on the 3 \"R's\"- Reduce, Re-use, Recycle </strong>- The green team in South Africa has achieved significant energy savings (35 %, or 2.200.000 kwh per annum) in power consumption using smart office technology e.g. movement sensors, LED globes, or even as simple as getting staff to switch off appliances not in use. We also save water through implementing tap aerators (about 80% reduction) and save paper through the Print Wise campaign (200.000 sheets of A4 printing paper save p.a.). We set up a facility at Citi South Africa to collect the recyclable waste separately both from the office and staff homes (40.000 kg waste recycled in 2012). We also have community initiatives to donate or plant trees in our schools and communities. <br><br>What we do today will profoundly affect future generations. The Citi South Africa Green Team aims to be a part of a sustainable future for the planet, the economy and society. If the environment as a whole is sustainable, it will be enable all of us to grow and thrive into the future.","image":"638e32d2a3c47c530c0a689a","year":"2013","publishDate":"May 03, 2013","type":"insights","title":"Living in a Better World: 3 Ways Citi Green Teams Are Making This Possible","author.jobTitle":[" Citi South Africa Green Team Member","Citi South Africa Green Team Member"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2013/living-in-a-better-world-3-ways-citi-green-teams-are-making-this-possible","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"05","author.displayName":["Ferenc Benda","Raoul Blignaut"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"Mumbai - Citi India today announced that it has been acknowledged as the Greenwich 'Share' and 'Quality Leader' for corporate banking as well as the Quality Leader for cash management in a study conducted by Greenwich Associates across large key corporates in India.

As with so much conventional wisdom, there's an element of truth: For many Americans, a mortgage is indeed the most attractive way to borrow because interest rates are not only low, but also the interest is often tax-deductible. <br><br>But a mortgage isn't some sort of financial freebie--and too much mortgage debt can create severe financial headaches. How so? Consider three issues. <br><br>First, even if your mortgage interest is tax-deductible, it's still costing you a lot more than it is costing Uncle Sam. Let's say you are in the 25% federal income-tax bracket. If you incur $1 of mortgage interest, you might save 25 cents in federal taxes, which means the other 75 cents is coming out of your pocket. Moreover, your mortgage interest is only reducing your tax bill if you itemize your deductions on your federal tax return, rather than taking the standard deduction. For further information, consider consulting a tax professional. <br><br>Second, while mortgage rates are often low, they are typically higher than the yield you could earn by stashing your extra cash in a savings account or a certificate of deposit. The implication: Instead of putting money in these savings vehicles, you may be better off paying down your mortgage. <br><br>Third, a large monthly mortgage payment could leave you in a financial bind, especially if you lose your job. And even if the monthly payments are manageable, you likely have other goals you need to save for, such as retirement and your children's college costs. The larger your mortgage payment, the harder it'll be to meet these other goals. Indeed, for many folks, retirement only becomes possible when the mortgage is paid off--and that big monthly expense goes away. <br><br>","image":"638e32d5a3c47c530c0a68a5","year":"2013","publishDate":"May 02, 2013","type":"insights","title":"No, You Shouldn't Take Out the Largest Mortgage Possible","author.jobTitle":["Director of Financial Education, Citi Personal Wealth Management"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2013/no-you-shouldnt-take-out-the-largest-mortgage-possible","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"05","author.displayName":["Jonathan Clements"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"New York - Deputy Mayor Robert K.

Business alignment and execution are critically important and we make sure that our sustainability strategy is aligned with and embedded in Citi's businesses, and that our initiatives are implementable. Citi was named last month as the \"World's Greenest Bank\" by <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2013-04-02/citigroup-blows-by-santander-as-greenest-bank-on-wind-power-push.html\">Bloomberg Markets</a>. This is due to a strong sustainability strategy, and strong execution. Our approach to sustainability is: <br><br>• Listen. Customers may not choose a bank because of its environmental leadership, at least not yet, but being an environmentally and socially responsible company is increasingly important to our customers and our employees. Our Core Principles--Common Purpose, Leadership, Ingenuity, and Responsible Finance--tie directly to our sustainability efforts, as does our deep commitment to engagement with partner stakeholders. We engage with a wide range of stakeholders to stay on top of trends and risks and also to identify areas of mutual opportunity. This helps both enable and inform our approach to sustainability. <br><br>• Scale. When our environmental sustainability program began in the late 1990s, our initial focus was just internal--to measure and then reduce our operational footprint as a way to reduce operational costs and understand the energy efficiency market. The program has grown over time to be increasingly client focused. We work with our clients to manage environmental and social risks, and develop environmentally friendly products and services such as financing alternative energy. <br><br>• Create Impact. We were the first bank in the world to reach 200 LEED certified facilities last year. In 2003, Citi co-founded the Equator Principles, which have become the gold standard for managing environmental and social risk in project finance. Additionally, we are a leader in energy finance and have financed some of the largest wind and solar energy projects in the world. <br><br>• Set Goals. We are confident that we will hit our 10-year, $50 Billion Climate finance goal by our 2016 target year, if not before. Reaching this goal is important for a couple of reasons. First, it is a signal of how fast the market for alternative energy and clean tech is growing and maturing. And second, it is testament to Citi's expertise in environmental finance. This goal has been a significant effort that brought in expertise from across our operational units and our lines of business. Citi celebrated its 200th anniversary last year. And we know that, for Citi to thrive for the next 200 years, we must excel in each core area of our business. <br><br>Starting today, to mark sustainability month, we will be sharing with you a series of green tips from Citi employees around the world, as well as information about on how digitization, renewable energy, biodiversity and improved infrastructure can help create a better, more sustainable world.","image":"638e32d6a3c47c530c0a68ad","year":"2013","publishDate":"May 01, 2013","type":"insights","title":"Living in a Better, More Sustainable World","author.jobTitle":["CEO and President, the Citi Foundation and Director, Corporate Citizenship"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2013/living-in-a-better-more-sustainable-world","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"05","author.displayName":["Pam Flaherty"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"Manama, Bahrain - Citi hosted its Middle East Research Day event for the second year in a row at the Intercontinental Regency Hotel with the aim of sharing the views of its leading economists and analyst on the current global macroeconomic environment.

The inefficient use of energy in under-served communities is also a contributor to climate change. But what if there were a way that lower-income communities could help reduce greenhouse gas emissions while also improving their financial and energy usage profiles? <br><br>In Mongolia, many lower-income residents live in portable tent-like structures--called gers--that are traditionally under-insulated and heated by inefficient coal-burning stoves that contribute to the notorious air pollution in the country's urban centers. However, a simple household insulation product (a \"ger blanket\") can greatly increase heat retention and--together with more energy efficient stoves--lower the rate of costly fossil fuel consumption and harmful carbon emissions. <br><br>The two issues are linked, since gers have to be paid for and the lack of financial resources slows their adoption. To help speed the widespread installation of more ger blankets while unlocking access to financial services for underserved Mongolians, Citi Microfinance worked with three partners: Citi's own London-based Environmental Products Trading &amp; Origination team, the U.S.-based social enterprise <a href=\"https://microenergycredits.com/\">MicroEnergy Credits</a>, and Mongolia's XacBank. <br><br>Here's how our solution works: <br><br>• Mongolia's XacBank is providing microloans that its customers can use to purchase ger blankets and efficient cookstoves. With improved burning efficiency and better insulation, less heating is required, resulting in reductions of carbon emissions. <br>• Those reductions are then assigned to MicroEnergy Credits, which develops carbon finance projects and brings clean energy to low income households in developing countries in partnership with financial institutions. <br>• MicroEnergy Credits then quantifies, aggregates and sells the credits to Citi, which in turn seeks to sell them on the open market. <br>• Proceeds from Citi's carbon credit purchase are distributed to XacBank via MicroEnergy Credits, allowing the Mongolian lender to expand its clean energy program, build additional marketing and customer service centers, and increase access to affordable clean energy loans. <br><br>Over the next six years, the arrangement is expected to generate at least 1.17 million metric tons of carbon credits, enable 100,000 Mongolian households to save money on energy with access to home improvement microloans, and substantially reduce harmful greenhouse gas emissions. The deal demonstrates that the microfinance sector has the ability to incentivize and impact the energy use of millions of low-income households around the world, helping them to clean the environment, improve their quality of life, save money, and responsibly build a credit history.","image":"638e32d8a3c47c530c0a68b6","year":"2013","publishDate":"April 30, 2013","type":"insights","title":"Expanding Financial Inclusion: Microfinance & Carbon Credits","author.jobTitle":["CEO, MicroEnergy Credits"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2013/expanding-financial-inclusion-microfinance-carbon-credits","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"04","author.displayName":["April Allderdice"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"Warsaw, Poland - \"Financial Independence for Women,\" a program of the Kronenberg Foundation at Citi Handlowy and the Women's Rights Centre, was among the 10 best practices honored in the competition \"Together We Are Building Social Capital.\" The competition is part of a project being carried out by the Polish Confederation of Private Employers Lewiatan and Deloitte as a platform for collaboration between the NGO sector and business.","month":"04","year":"2013","publishDate":"April 29, 2013","siteId":"citigpa","type":"insights","title":"Poland: Kronenberg Foundation Honored for Building Social Capital for Women","category":"PRESS RELEASE","url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/press-release/2013/poland-kronenberg-foundation-honored-for-building-social-capital-for-women","tags":["Press Release Migration","Environmental, Social & Governance"]},{"summary":"Access to reliable and affordable financial products is critical when it comes to saving money for education, protecting against setbacks, or borrowing to start a business. Globally, more than 2.5 billion people are unbanked or underbanked, lacking access to the financial services necessary to engage in the local economy and safely conduct basic transactions. Solutions to many of these challenges come in the form of microfinance institutions (MFIs) that help provide access to specialized financial products. <br><br>A common dilemma faced in the sector is how to offer savings products that are both attractive to and appropriate for the most vulnerable populations, but that financial institutions can also support from a business perspective. <br><br><a href=\"https://www.pro-savings.org/en\">The ProSavings Program</a>, created in 2011 by the<a href=\"https://www.fomin.org/\"> Multilateral Investment Fund (MIF)</a> at the <a href=\"https://www.iadb.org/en/inter-american-development-bank,2837.html\">Inter-American Development Bank (IADB)</a> with support from the Citi Foundation, checks both boxes. The innovative program works with financial institutions to create tailored savings products for recipients of government payments, upon which many low-income families rely, in Latin America and the Caribbean. <br><br>One of the challenges that financial institutions face is the operational costs associated with offering liquid and planned savings products for small deposits. ProSavings' participating financial entities are developing different business strategies that include an important technology component to address this challenge, making it easier to connect the unbanked with the financial mainstream. <br><br><strong>How ProSavings is making a difference:</strong> <br><br>• In <strong>El Salvador</strong>, a network of small business owners is serving as banking agents by installing bank terminals in their businesses, making it easy for government payment recipients to conduct withdrawals, deposits, payments, and other transactions using mobile banking services. <br>• In the <strong>Dominican Republic</strong>, recent regulation on banking agents will allow the ProSavings projects to expand their reach and lower the cost of offering savings products. Additionally, establishments that currently process payments through the Progresando con Solidaridad Program's subsidy cards will receive an upgrade to banking agent status, allowing rural women who receive government payments to conduct other financial transactions without having to travel to a bank branch. <br>• Cooperatives participating in a ProSavings project in <strong>Colombia</strong> will develop \"mini-branch\" service points through which they will offer customized assistance to clients and provide all the services that are normally offered at a bank branch. <br><br>In each of these examples, government payment recipients will be able to seamlessly dedicate part of those payments or other cash flows that they have to their savings, helping them build their financial resiliency while creating a financial profile that is critical to accessing additional resources to improve their lives. The Citi Foundation's work with IADB in creating the ProSavings Program is opening up opportunities in areas such as business, housing, and education for people who were previously excluded from the formal financial system.","image":"638e32daa3c47c530c0a68bf","year":"2013","publishDate":"April 29, 2013","type":"insights","title":"Expanding Financial Inclusion: Microfinance","author.jobTitle":["null","null","Access to Finance Unit, Multilateral Investment Fund, Inter-American Development Bank"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2013/expanding-financial-inclusion-microfinance","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"04","author.displayName":["Fermin Vivanco","Maria Luisa Hayem","Andrea Reyes"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"Moscow - ZAO Citibank and United Card Service (UCS), the largest payment card processing company in Russia and a subsidiary of the US-based Global Payments Inc., announced the signing of an agreement through which Citi will recommend to its clients UCS as an exclusive provider of POS and internet acquiring services in Russia.

And, this research showed that most parents (75 percent) said that a college degree is necessary to get ahead in today's world. However, the price of college has increased 1,120% in the last 30 years (<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-08-15/cost-of-college-degree-in-u-s-soars-12-fold-chart-of-the-day.html\">Bloomberg</a>). <br><br>Enabling parents to pay for their child's education is exactly why the City and County of San Francisco worked with Citi Community Development to create a Kindergarten to College program (K2C). Through this program, a kindergartner receives a college savings account containing its first $50 deposit that, if added to regularly, can become a 12-year head start towards college tuition. <br><br>A college savings plan can make a huge difference. College grads tend to get better jobs, avoid layoffs, and earn more money over their careers. In fact, college doesn't just change lives, it transforms communities. <br><br>K2C automatically opens savings accounts for all incoming kindergarten students in the San Francisco Unified School District. In addition to the initial deposit contributed by the City and County of San Francisco, savings matches and incentives are provided by private philanthropy to encourage families to save early and often. <br><br>One important part of this program is that financial literacy skills are being taught in classrooms using the students' own accounts to provide real-world context. Students and their families can also track the accounts using <a href=\"https://mysavingsaccount.com/k2c/Login.aspx?lang=en\">a new, interactive website</a> created by Citi for this program.

As smartphone adoption increases in the United States and worldwide, more people are engaging in mobile activities beyond simply making phone calls - and that includes on-the-go money management. <br><br>According to Consumers and Mobile Financial Services 2013, a just-released report from the U.S. Federal Reserve, \"the use of mobile financial services is particularly prevalent among the 10 percent of the population that is underbanked.\" The report also states that \"among the 90 percent of underbanked consumers with mobile phones, 49 percent had used mobile banking in the 12 months preceding November 2012, up from 29 percent in December 2011.\" * <br><br>These mobile trends point to opportunities for financial technology innovation to better educate and reach the unbanked and underbanked through mobile devices. <br><br>The Citi Foundation, the Center for Financial Services Innovation (CFSI) and the Doorways to Dreams Fund, together with a broad collection of partners, have come together to create the <a href=\"https://www.fincapdev.com/\">FinCapDev Competition</a>, a mobile app development challenge to create innovative financial tools that will empower Americans to use technology to help adopt responsible financial behaviors. <br><br>Participants in the competition include budding entrepreneurs, mobile developers and socially-minded innovators who have ideas for creative and user-friendly apps they hope will serve the unbanked and underbanked. App proposals include creative tools that help mobile users with budgeting, paying off debt, saving for retirement and more. <br><br>The finalists have been chosen for the eight-month, nationwide challenge, which started in October 2012 and will culminate in a Grand Prize winner, two Runner-Up winners and two Honorable Mentions. Winners will be awarded cash stipends from a $100,000 pool to fund their start-up. Along the way, competitors receive critical advice and coaching support from a carefully selected group of industry experts plus access to industry insights via webinars, talks, and mentorship from partner organizations such as MasterCard, Deloitte, Yodlee, Facebook, Citi and Dell Social Innovation Challenge. <br><br>The first phase of the competition brought in a wide range of innovative app design proposals. Ideas include apps that will help consumers determine whether to buy an insurance plan for a small-ticket item, make it easier for first-time homebuyers to save for a down payment, and aid students in assessing the appropriate level of debt to assume, taking into account potential earnings of their chosen career and tuition at their chosen educational institution.

That might seem like an odd question given the oft-repeated advice to shovel as much as you can into 401(k) plans, traditional Individual Retirement Accounts and Roth IRAs. <br><br>And, indeed, if your employer offers a 401(k), 403(b) or similar plan, you should contribute at least enough to qualify for the company's full matching contribution. That match represents extra money that it would be foolish to pass up. Even without an employer match, your contributions to a 401(k) or traditional IRA may be tax-deductible. If you do the math, you may find the investment growth on these initial tax savings can end up paying for the taxes due when you make withdrawals. And, of course, tax-free growth is the big appeal of both Roth IRAs and Roth 401(k) plans. <br><br>The downside: It's difficult to tap these various retirement accounts before age 59½ without getting hit with early withdrawal penalties. <br><br>To be sure, there are exceptions. For instance, you may be able to borrow from your 401(k). But borrowing can be risky. In fact, 401(k) loans have to be repaid right away if you lose or leave your job. If you can't come up with the money to repay the loan, you could get hit with taxes and penalties. <br><br>Similarly, you can make a withdrawal from an IRA and avoid penalties (though not any income taxes that are due) if you meet certain conditions, such as making a first-time home purchase or paying for qualified higher education expenses. The Roth IRA also provides unusual flexibility: If you make a regular $5,500 annual contribution to a Roth, you can withdraw that contribution at any time and there won't be any taxes or penalties owed, provided you don't withdraw any of the account's investment gains. <br><br>Still, given all the restrictions that apply to retirement accounts, you may want to funnel some savings into a regular taxable account. That way, you'll be in better shape if you suddenly need money for a financial emergency. Building up your taxable account can also be a smart move if you hope to retire before age 59½, because you won't have to worry about the penalty on early retirement-account withdrawals. <br><br>","image":"638e32e5a3c47c530c0a68fd","year":"2013","publishDate":"April 09, 2013","type":"insights","title":" Retirement Accounts: Too Much of a Good Thing?","author.jobTitle":["Director of Financial Education, Citi Personal Wealth Management"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2013/retirement-accounts-too-much-of-a-good-thing","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"04","author.displayName":["Jonathan Clements"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"Thank you for taking the time to share your <a href=\"https://blog.citigroup.com/2013/03/you-spoke-we-listened.shtml\">comments and questions</a>.

Without a credit score, these individuals cannot get a loan to buy a car, start a business, or secure housing --all crucial to increasing a person's economic stability and the ability to contribute to his or her community. Housing is a basic need, which is why Citi continues to work with partners like Mission Asset Fund to make access to affordable housing a keep component of our shared efforts to broaden financial inclusion. <br><br>MAF's core focus is helping the unbanked access loans and build credit scores by formalizing loans traditionally created among peer groups outside of the mainstream banking system. The idea is simple: groups of people create lending circles that allow each member to chip in and give one participant a lump-sum, zero-interest, zero-fee loan. To date, MAF has managed more than $1.5 million in loans over four years with a default rate close to zero. <br><br>I'm proud that our innovative social lending model has garnered a lot of attention as a way to link participants with the mainstream credit system. Now, with help from our longtime supporter Citi Community Development, MAF is taking the next step to connect our underserved clients with housing that will enable them to continue to climb the economic ladder. <br><br>Lower-income young adults, foster youth and reentry populations often have no credit score and little savings to cover rent security deposits, creating real financial barriers to securing safe and stable places to live. Through an innovative pilot security deposit loan program, MAF will provide landlords and housing partners with vouchers for security deposits and will then service the interest-free loans, report repayment activity to credit bureaus, and return the deposit at the end of the lease term to borrowers. By the end of the program, young renters will have credit histories and seeded savings, putting them in a stronger position to rent apartments on their own and create the foundations that are critical to longer term success. <br><br><em><em>Jose Quinonez is a recipient of a 2013 James Irvine Foundation Leadership Award.

To streamline the process, only setup play dates with other parents who utilize email or text messaging. <br>b) Set up those play dates during your daily commute. <br>c) There is nothing wrong with sending your husband an email reminder to pick up milk (or any other errand). Don't forget to flag the email for follow up. <br><br><strong>4) Make sure to network </strong> <br><br>a) Everyone has moments of frustration while trying to balance a demanding career with a personal life. Network with other women to hear their stories and know that you are not alone. b) Never forget to pay it forward. You will benefit from friends and colleagues guiding you throughout your career. Always say \"thank you\" and make sure you do the same for others. <br><br><strong>5) Approach your career with passion and be open to creativity </strong> <br><br>a) After having a child, you may lose some mobility. However, try to take advantage of short-term opportunities your employer may provide. For example, Citi offers creative opportunities for short-term international assignments. A one week guest reviewer opportunity in El Salvador is comparable to a vacation if you have three kids under 7 years old! <br>b) Arrive at the flight departure lounge 30 minutes early. Buy a coffee and a newspaper, savoring the fact that you can peacefully read it from cover to cover. Do not feel guilty to enjoy these quiet moments. <br>c) Develop a personal board of directors for career advice and sponsorship. Your husband should not be on this board and your sponsor should not turn in to your \"work-husband.\" <br><br><em>Wendy Lofgren-Aviles is a 15-year Citi banker, a Senior Credit Officer, and the global re-engineering director for the Office of the Chief Appraiser.

From fine tuning our mobile app to celebrating International Women's Day, Citi always strives to be an industry leader across a range of events, initiatives and causes. <br><br>We want to make sure we are delivering the latest company happenings and stories to those who want to stay on top of Citi events and announcements. Hence this new series, \"Wrap-up: Stories and Events from The Week that Was.\" Whenever there's a flurry of Citi activity or interesting stories from our employees or partners to share. we'll let you know. This week, we're covering two stories: Citi Community Development Helps Launch Home Matters and The Road to Recovery Kickoff. <br><br><strong>The Road to Recovery Kickoff </strong> <br>Since 2007, Citi is proud to have helped more than 1.1 million homeowners avoid potential foreclosure and remain in their homes. This week, CitiMortgage announced the launch of its 2013 Road to Recovery Tour, a customer outreach program where Citi's Mortgage assistance experts consult one-on-one with CitiMortgage Customers in need of assistance with their mortgages. The 2013 tour kicked off yesterday in St. Louis and will visit eleven cities. Find event details @ https://citi.us/ZGeySe and view a short video https://citi.us/ZXeCNi. Please visit our mortgage community at www.homeownersupport.com if you need assistance or your city is not yet on our calendar. <br><br><strong>Citi Community Development Helps Launch Home Matters</strong> <br><em>This update comes from Holly Olson Vice President of the Board of National NeighborWorks Association and Executive Director of Neighborhood Finance Corporation in Des Moines, IA.</em> <br><br>Citi has helped a coast-to-coast coalition of housing and community development organizations launch a unique national initiative called Home Matters, which aims to build public support for the essential role that Home plays as the bedrock of thriving lives, families, and a stronger nation. Home Matters will shine a much-needed spotlight on the larger power of Home: supporting people's identities, protecting and nurturing families, providing essential links to communities, and serving as the base for a stronger America. <br><br>It's especially appropriate that the launch took place during International Women's Month, given the crucial role that women play in making Home a reality. According to the White House Council on Women and Girls, more than 80 percent of adult Americans (age 15 or older) live in households headed or co-headed by women. Home Matters grew out of the recognition that the crucial role Home plays in America is not sufficiently understood or valued. As a result, Home Matters will do the following: <br>• Educate: Spread the word about the benefits of Home <br>• Collaborate: Bring disparate organizations and industries together under one banner <br>• Engage: Rally local leaders and mobilize the public <br>• Advocate: Encourage policymakers to protect and support Home and related initiatives <br>• Support: Raise funds and increase investments to sustain the work that makes Home a reality for more Americans <br>• Celebrate: Promote and honor the extraordinary impact of Home <br><br>To learn more, visit www.HomeMattersAmerica.com and share your own insights. Help us, for instance, in illuminating what Home means to Americans throughout the nation by completing the sentence \"Home is...\" in 140 characters or less. We'll be tweeting the definitions regularly and posting them on the website. Submit photographs, as well, that capture what Home is to you. You'll be amazed at the range of images and ideas that convey the fundamental importance and profound power of Home.","image":"638e32efa3c47c530c0a6931","month":"03","year":"2013","publishDate":"March 29, 2013","siteId":"citigpa","type":"insights","title":"Wrap-Up: Citi Stories and Events from The Week that Was","category":"PERSPECTIVES","url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2013/wrap-up-citi-stories-and-events-from-the-week-that-was","tags":["Perspective Migration"]},{"summary":"Chicago - Today, Citi Community Development and Urban Prep Academies announced a commitment to expand the school's Project GOLD (Getting Our Lion's Degrees) initiative to bolster the college success rate of Urban Prep graduates.

Thank you for continuing to share your ideas and concerns. Your feedback helps us understand where we can do better, and helps guide our improvements to deliver the experience you deserve. We have heard that you want simpler ways to manage your account, easier ways to save money on purchases, and more ways to enjoy the ThankYou Rewards you have earned. Here is an update on some recent changes and updates we have made based on this feedback. <br><br><strong>You told us getting lower prices is important to you when making purchases, and when there is a difference in price it should be easy to get money back. We agree. </strong>Citi Price Rewind is a complimentary benefit to help you save on purchases after checkout -- to date, we have found a lower price for one out of every four registered items over $100. The average refund for cardmembers who have submitted a claim is $80! For those of you who have not tried it yet, simply shop with your Citi card and register your purchase with us online. We will search hundreds of retailers' web sites for a lower price for 30 days after your purchase. If we find your item at a price at least $25 less than what you paid, you can request a refund for the difference.

This is a free service which allows cardmembers to generate a substitute credit card number which can be used in place of their real credit card number during online or telephone shopping. While only a small number of you used our VAN functionality, we want you to know we heard loud and clear that you want to continue using this service. We will be bringing this back at the end of April and will send you a notification when it is available again. <br><br><strong>You told us that having more ways to use your ThankYou® Rewards is important to you.</strong> Last year, we introduced new options, and you will continue to see more this year.

But there's another reason for this caution: longevity risk. At issue here is the risk that retirees might outlive their savings. And, yes, it's a very real risk. <br><br>When today's 65-year-olds were born in 1948, the life expectancy for men was around age 73, while for women it was 79, according to figures from the Social Security Administration. But such averages can be a bad guide for today's retirees because they are dragged down by those who die before they reach retirement age. <br><br>Instead, retirees might focus on life expectancy as of age 65. According to Social Security, a man who is age 65 today can expect to live until 83, while a 65-year-old woman might live until 85. Moreover, keep in mind that these are just averages. One out of every four of today's 65-year-olds will live past age 90, while one out of 10 will live past 95. <br><br>This highlights the value of lifetime income, such as a traditional company pension plan and Social Security. Want even more lifetime income? You might weigh the pros and cons of different annuities that'll pay you income for as long as you live. This annuity income would be based on the claims-paying ability of the issuing insurance company. Guarantees do not apply to the investment performance or safety of any underlying subaccounts held within the annuity. <br><br><br><br>INVESTMENT AND INSURANCE PRODUCTS: NOT FDIC INSURED • NOT A BANK DEPOSIT • NOT INSURED BY ANY FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGENCY • NO BANK GUARANTEE • MAY LOSE VALUE <br><br>This is intended for informational purposes only.

I have always enjoyed managing people and continue to refine my leadership style. It is hugely rewarding to see a company benefit from good leadership. Here are some of my thoughts on how to refine this quality. <br><br><strong>1. Enable career development in others. </strong> <br><br>As a professional leader, remember that you are responsible for helping develop people's careers. To ensure this happens, make sure you challenge your employees to do their best. Providing recognition for a job well done is equally important. <br><br><strong>2. Be accountable for your own decisions. </strong> <br><br>Own your decisions. Never blame senior management or \"head office.\" If you are executing a decision, you must be accountable for the results. <br><br><strong>3. Be adaptable. Be a leader for all seasons. </strong> <br><br>You will need to lead through good times, bad times and times of change. This will require adaptability in your skills. <br><br><strong>4. Have an eye toward the future.</strong> <br><br>Lift your vision. Be a leader with an eye on the future. Be sure that your team understands your long-term strategy. <br><br><strong>5. Create an inclusive work environment. </strong> <br><br>While this may seem obvious, treating everyone with respect and creating feelings of inclusivity is key to maintaining a creative, productive work environment. Reward the correct behaviors and disincentivize the wrong ones. Simply put, these efforts will help employees feel comfortable, welcome and challenged within the workspace.","image":"638e32f2a3c47c530c0a6946","year":"2013","publishDate":"March 25, 2013","type":"insights","title":"Philippa Nesbit: Five Messages to My Younger Self About Leadership","author.jobTitle":["Chief Risk Officer, Citi Private Bank and Citi Holdings"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2013/philippa-nesbit-five-messages-to-my-younger-self-about-leadership","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"03","author.displayName":["Philippa Nesbit"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"Dublin and Belfast - Citi announced the winning teams of the 2013 upStart Awards held at the Citi offices in Dublin.

But which investments should you hold in which? <br><br>Everybody's financial situation is different, of course. Still, you might look to hold tax-inefficient investments in your retirement accounts, where any earnings can grow tax-deferred or, in the case of a Roth IRA or Roth 401(k), potentially tax-free. Meanwhile, for your taxable account, you might steer clear of investments that generate ordinary income, which can be taxed at a maximum 39.6% federal rate in 2013, and instead favor investments that could deliver qualified dividends and long-term capital gains, both of which are taxed at a maximum 20%. <br><br>For instance, actively managed stock funds often do a fair amount of trading that leads to large taxable distributions, including short-term gains that are subject to ordinary income-tax rates.

I started working at Citi as a management associate more than 24 years ago. I have worked in Nigeria, London and South Africa in a variety of roles, from operations to relationship and product management. I am currently the EMEA Public Sector Head for the Citi Transactions Services business, based in London. <br><br>The topic of leadership is important to me because banking is a service and solutions related business, which is dependent on the caliber of the workforce. Even though management gurus expound time-honored, enduring principles, leadership is a constantly evolving topic. I prefer taking on a more centered and holistic approach to becoming an effective leader. Being a successful leader translates not just to a work environment, but life itself. Here are five tips to my younger self about leadership: <br><br><strong>1. Find meaning in what you do </strong> <br>It is important to relate what you do to your broader values and aspirations. Aligning your profession to your overall purpose as an individual makes work another avenue of self-expression; it can become an extension of your personal brand or legacy. <br><br><strong>2. Take on a positive frame of mind</strong> <br>Contextualize experiences, especially those that are challenging or stressful. Try not to view events through a negative lens. Constraints can become opportunities and our greatest perceived failings can be a source of even greater learning. <br><br><strong>3. Connect and network with peers </strong> <br>Try to test ideas or solicit advice from a diverse network of people.

I have had the opportunity to hold different roles within the company, such as attracting, developing and retaining a diverse employee workforce and fostering an inclusive and respectful work environment. Outside of the office, one of the most important roles I hold is being a mother to my 17-year-old daughter, Alissa. <br><br>When I joined Citi, I was not aware I was pregnant. My husband and I had faced infertility challenges, so we were thrilled once we learned I was expecting. However, I was scared because I had just started a new position at a new company and was facing a 4-hour daily commute. I knew Citi would offer great opportunities, but was concerned about balancing professional and personal responsibilities. <br><br>I returned to work eight weeks after giving birth to Alissa. The first few months were very challenging. During one particularly stressful week, Alissa was hospitalized with an unknown virus. I was tired from lack of sleep and felt a bit out of control at home, at work and in my personal life. I was on the brink of leaving Citi. However, my situation improved. Through my own experience, I would like to share a few life lessons, which may help those of you navigating work, motherhood and pursuing your life goals. <br><br>1. <strong>Set priorities. </strong>Not everything has to be completed! I have tried to get everything done- baking cookies, folding laundry at 10 p.m., playing with my daughter, giving her a bath and reading stories. However, I somehow felt I could not perform every task well. The key lesson here is to prioritize daily tasks, rather than trying to tackle everything. Don't sweat the small stuff! <br><br>2. <strong>Clarify expectations.</strong> It is important to establish expectations for yourself and your family. As a commuter, I am never home in the morning to see my daughter. I once asked her if this bothered her and she said no. She understood that the long hours I worked could prevent me from being involved in every aspect of her daily life. This helped me let go of the belief that I could be letting her down. This simple example helped me learn how to create a common understanding between me and my daughter. <br><br>3. <strong>Be present.</strong> Like many children, Alissa participated in school functions, sports teams and other school activities. I could not attend all of the events and often had feelings of guilt. Through careful planning, I began to make sure I attended those most important to her. Learning to be a presence in your child's life is perhaps one of the most important aspects of motherhood. <br><br>4. <strong>Have a supportive partner/spouse.</strong> My husband is very supportive of my career. He and I talk about our schedules each week to ensure someone can take care of Alissa. He was and continues to be very proud of my accomplishments. His incredible attitude has allowed me to take on greater professional responsibilities. The moral of the story is learning to share responsibilities with your spouse/partner! <br><br>5. <strong>Get involved and build your networks.</strong> As a working mother, it is important to achieve personal growth by becoming involved in something outside of the professional and family environment. I chose volunteering to achieve this goal. The activities I participated in helped me build a strong network in my local area, enabling me to learn more about opportunities for Alissa and my family. I coached basketball for six years, served as the class mom for four years and was an advisor to the Ski Club for three years. During Alissa's high school years, I was involved in the PTO, Booster Club and sports associations. Currently, I am part of several boards and professional organizations that have helped broaden my network. These affiliations don't require a large time commitment and have helped me form some lasting friendships. <br><br><strong>Bonus tip: Be good to yourself!</strong> Take a walk, enjoy a good book, laugh with an old friend and breathe. The positive energy these actions create can have a great impact on your child and your family.","image":"638e32f6a3c47c530c0a6960","year":"2013","publishDate":"March 13, 2013","type":"insights","title":"Ana Duarte: Five Messages to My Younger Self About Being a Working Mom","author.jobTitle":["Chief Diversity Officer, Citi"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2013/ana-duarte-five-messages-to-my-younger-self-about-being-a-working-mom","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"03","author.displayName":["Ana Duarte"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"If you're approaching retirement and want to get more from Social Security, consider a strategy known as \"file and suspend.\" It can be particularly useful for married couples, especially when one spouse has earned significantly more than the other. <br><br>Let's say Jack is the primary breadwinner and has reached his full Social Security retirement age, which is 66 for those born between 1943 and 1954. His wife Jill is 62. They're a traditional couple where Jack has worked fulltime and Jill spent several years out of the workforce raising their children. If Jack started taking his benefit now, he would receive $2,400 based on his lifetime earnings, while Jill would get $600 a month based on her earnings record. <br><br>One possibility: Jack might apply now for Social Security--but then immediately suspend collecting. Why bother? Because he applied for benefits, Jill can claim a spousal benefit based on his earnings record. That spousal benefit could be as much as half of Jack's benefit, but it's reduced because Jill is 62 and hence younger than her full retirement age. Because of that reduction, her benefit would be $840, which is still more than the $600 she could receive based on her own earnings record. If Jill wanted a larger monthly check, she could wait to claim her spousal benefit. <br><br>Meanwhile, the couple could opt to dip more heavily into savings so Jack can put off restarting his Social Security benefit until age 70. That would increase his monthly check to $3,168. (This doesn't reflect any increases for inflation.) If Jack dies before Jill, she can give up her spousal benefit and start taking his higher benefit as a survivor benefit. In effect, for Jill, the file-and-suspend strategy has two big advantages: In addition to getting more money with the spousal benefit, she could also potentially get a larger survivor benefit. For additional information, contact your local Social Security office and also consider discussing the implications for your overall finances with a financial professional. <br><br><br><br>","image":"638e32f8a3c47c530c0a6969","year":"2013","publishDate":"March 13, 2013","type":"insights","title":"Want More from Social Security?

In that time, I have found that networking continues to be just as important in my role today as it was when I first arrived in D.C. after graduating law school. Here are five tips I would write to my younger self about networking: <br><br>1. Networking is a two-way street. If you want help, be prepared to give help in return. <br><br>2. It takes work to network. Follow up on all opportunities and with all contacts. If the person can't help you directly, ask if he or she knows someone who can. <br><br>3. Treat everyone with respect. The most junior staffers will someday be in the most senior positions of power--and they will have long memories. <br><br>4. Utilize local networks. Young professionals groups, alumni networks and even book clubs offer great opportunities to connect with people who share your background and interests. Always leave a meeting with one or two new contacts. <br><br>5. Be specific. When asking for help, the more specific you can be, the better. People are happy to follow through with one or two direct favors, but most don't have the time (or patience) to chase ambiguous or vague requests.","image":"638e32f9a3c47c530c0a6970","year":"2013","publishDate":"March 11, 2013","type":"insights","title":"Candi Wolff: Five Messages to My Younger Self About Networking","author.jobTitle":["Executive Vice President, Global Government Affairs, Citi"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2013/candi-wolff-five-messages-to-my-younger-self-about-networking","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"03","author.displayName":["Candi Wolff"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"image":"638e32fba3c47c530c0a6979","month":"03","author.displayName":["Mona Masri"],"year":"2013","publishDate":"March 11, 2013","siteId":"citigpa","type":"insights","title":"CT Prospera: An Alternative to Alternative Financial Products","category":"PERSPECTIVES","author.jobTitle":["Senior Vice President, Citi Community Development"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2013/ct-prospera-an-alternative-to-alternative-financial-products","tags":["Perspective Migration"]},{"summary":"Singapore - Citi celebrated International Women's Day (IWD) in a big way this week.

I never dreamed that many years later I would be based in Mexico working for Citi as the LatAm Regional Head of Enterprise Risk Management, managing the operational risk of all our businesses in the entire region. At the time I didn't even know what operational risk was or that it even existed. The risk management I knew was based on hedging positions with derivatives, and the derivatives at that time weren't very complicated. <br><br>In honor of International Women's Day, I was asked to think about what advice I would give to myself at the beginning of my career. Below are five messages I would tell my younger self around career advancement. <br><br><strong>1. Don't focus so much on a particular job but rather on the characteristics of the job:</strong> identify the aspects that are important to you, what gives you energy, what interests you. Do you like projects or do you prefer to have structured tasks? What skills and strengths do you want to leverage and use? Ten years ago, I was struggling with what direction I wanted my career to take. I had spent several years focused on trying to get a specific job and then when I had that job I found I was completely bored. I knew I had to make a move, but to what? That was when I started to evaluate not specific job titles or positions but rather all the pieces that make up a job--what did I want those pieces to be? Once you have those pieces identified, recognize opportunity, seize it and be true to yourself. As women, we frequently make decisions because we feel an obligation or a commitment, even though what we decide may not be best for us. One of my best career decisions was based on what was right for me even though I had another commitment at the time. <br><br><strong>2. Decide on your own personal definition of success.</strong> Don't focus on titles or levels but rather are you passionate about your job? Does it give you meaning and purpose? Have patience--experience is rich and it all adds value. Even jobs that are unrelated and not part of a set career path will combine into a unique experience, knowledge and skill set that you can draw upon throughout your career. Make sure you apply lessons learned, especially from the jobs that were difficult or not that good of a fit. <br><br><strong>3. Being good at your job requires much more than just being smart.</strong> Success in any career, job, or even task requires more than mere intelligence. Certainly book smarts can help but career advancement requires many things such as perseverance, good communication skills, flexibility, adaptability, and most of all, experience. From my perspective nothing can replace experience and good judgment. Maybe it's because I'm a risk manager. The best risk managers don't just rely on quantitative models but draw upon their experience and differentiate themselves through their judgment. <br><strong><br>4. Don't be afraid to ask for help. </strong>This was a tough one for me to learn: ever since I was a child I had an \"I'll do it myself\" mentality. However, over time I began to discover that teamwork was important to me, that I got my best ideas and was my most creative when brainstorming with others. I realized that it's much better to raise your hand than to fail and, more important, that your boss doesn't want you to fail and will not think any less of you if you ask for support. It's not a weakness to ask for help, it's a strength and no one has ever turned me down when I requested help. I do have admit that in times of extreme stress, I sometimes still struggle with this. It's my default behavior, so I always have to be careful not to revert to it. <br><br><strong>5. Feedback is not personal and it is under your control.</strong> You can decide to act upon it or you can decide that it is incorrect. If it is incorrect, then you need to determine if it is a perception issue and what behavior is leading to that perception. Feedback helps you to become more self-aware, which then enables you to make the necessary changes for you to succeed.","image":"638e32fda3c47c530c0a6982","year":"2013","publishDate":"March 08, 2013","type":"insights","title":"Andrea Pozzi: Five Messages to My Younger Self About Career Advancement","author.jobTitle":["LatAm Regional Head, Enterprise Risk Management, Citi"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2013/andrea-pozzi-five-messages-to-my-younger-self-about-career-advancement","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"03","author.displayName":["Andrea Pozzi"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"Budapest, Hungary - After winning the #1 position for five years in a row from MasterCard for Best Bank Account of the Year with the revolutionary Citibank Zero Fee Bank Account launched in 2008, Citibank Hungary is launching another innovative product with outstanding benefits in its category, under the brand name of New 0 HUF Bank Account.

Now, imagine this world being an island that measures in length a marathon in one direction by a half-marathon in the other. <br><br>That's essentially the size of Singapore, the city-state jewel of Southeast Asia, endearingly known to both Singaporeans and foreigners as the Little Red Dot- but in spirit and scope, Singapore is anything but little! With access to half the world's population within a 4.5 hour (or less) flight, not to mention a stable and proactive government that embraces innovation and diversity, Singapore is an ideal base to set up a startup. <br><br>Living and working in a major hub such as Singapore certainly forces one to think globally -- a skill all entrepreneurs must have in spades today. Establishing a startup's home base in the center of a big, bustling city might feel overwhelming at first, but there are many advantages -- namely, better business resources, unprecedented networking opportunities, fast transportation and easy access to both talent and investors. <br><br>Fetch Plus Inc., the company I founded, based in Singapore, helps major brands and media companies leverage social media to deliver tangible business results. Here's a sneak peek into my average day in Singapore (and in the air above it) -- and some advice for other founders who find themselves in similar geographic circumstances: <br><br><strong>1.</strong> <strong>Go global; work virtual.</strong> <br><br>12:10 a.m.--I am disembarking from an eight-hour flight from Sydney and feeling the moist air of Singapore. I realize that in four hours, my daily Scrum with our product and tech teams will take place. As a startup founder, I've learned that dev teams appreciate either working from 10 p.m. through the night, or at the crack of dawn onwards. And since I travel extensively and take night flights as a rule of thumb, we adapted our \"office\" to be virtual and accommodate everyone's schedule. While we have an office in Singapore for financial operations and board/ investor meetings, and satellite offices in Australia and the U.S., most of our teams work from home. This has improved productivity and reduced the HR headaches that pop up in regular office settings. <br><br><strong>2. Engage every department daily.</strong> <br><br>5 a.m.-7 a.m.--During our Scrum, we stop to discuss some work in progress tickets (WIP). Right after, I call my sales team in Australia and my accounts team in the U.S. to make sure that their start of day/end of day is progressing as it should. As a founder, knowing how to engage in a variety of environments across as many fields as possible yields better outcomes for the company -- especially if you're working out of multiple countries, across different continents, like we do! Getting a strong handle on virtual chats like Google Hangouts helps --something I personally look forward to using. <br><br><strong>3. Soak up the culture--founders must learn to adapt to their surroundings. </strong> <br><br>7 a.m.-8:30 a.m.--This is my \"me time\" -- something that founders tend to forget. As a mother of three, with my youngest just seven months, having time to squarely focus on their needs is a must. Without fail, I go for my morning walk with my youngest in tow to go for a kopi-c (local coffee) and kaya toast at the oldest coffee stand on the island. These local treats are great reminders how much ordinary practices like breakfast can vary across cultures. I learn and adopt new ways constantly -- a great trait to practice as a founder. <br><br><strong>4. Partnerships are key in any zip code.</strong> <br><br>9:00 a.m.-6 p.m.--My day is jammed with what I like to call \"customer time.\" This is the time I'm devoted to staying connected to current and future customers. Today, I am off to train the sales teams of SingTel, one of our major partners in Southeast Asia. Afterward, I squeeze in some conference calls. Then, I return to SingTel, as their team has invited me to participate as a speaker at one of their conferences for small and medium-size enterprises. Setting up actionable partnerships for your startup has to be one of the most important things you do. The onus is always on the founder to drive the business, and that includes making partner relationships profitable. <br><br><strong>5. Nurture your network while going green. </strong> <br><br>6:30 p.m.- 7 p.m.--Catching up with your network, especially when you live in Singapore, is a smart goal. Luckily, Singapore is brimming with plenty of businesspeople and great local cafes/eateries/tech hubspots to meet them in. For time-strapped founders, it's important to be selective about who you catch for that quick coffee. Since I tend to be more on the strategy and product side, I enjoy meeting up with friends and mentors in that area. Singapore has done an amazing job of keeping sidewalks green, building effective sub-walkways full of shops and cafes to connect major buildings underground. There's also an extensive public transit system with some of the timeliest trains and bus lines in any major city -- a fact that's allowed me to go auto-free for three years and counting! <br><br><strong>6. Don't forget to rest!</strong> <br><br>7:00 p.m.-11 p.m.--Finally! My last bit of downtime, where I spend time with my family and take in the lights of the city before taking final conference calls and answering pre-sleep emails. Being in such a vibrant place like Singapore, filled with so many moving parts, makes you realize that its size is an asset. It makes you think broadly and globally about the future -- yours and your company's. <br><br><em>Carmen Benitez is the Founder of <a href=\"https://www.fetchfans.com/\">Fetch Plus Inc</a>, a social media technology company that specializes in developing plug and play social media SaaS enterprise solutions for brand franchises and media companies worldwide.

Looking ahead to 2013, I argue that, with equity markets not likely to re-rate again, the key to further market gains will be a solid rebound in GDP and earnings growth, which we expect. Our call is for EM equities to rise by close to 10% in 2013.","image":"638e3159a3c47c530c0a60b6","year":"2013","publishDate":"January 08, 2013","type":"insights","title":"Emerging Markets: The Earnings Challenge in 2013","author.jobTitle":["Global Emerging Markets Strategist"],"url":"https://www.citigroup.com/global/news/perspective/2013/emerging-markets-the-earnings-challenge-in-2013","tags":["Perspective Migration"],"month":"01","author.displayName":["Geoffrey Dennis"],"siteId":"citigpa","category":"PERSPECTIVES"},{"summary":"New York - Citi today released the following statement on the agreement in principle reached with the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) and the Federal Reserve Board regarding the Independent Foreclosure Review process.

Loan proceeds may be used for repair work ranging from systems replacement and storm mitigation retrofits to gut rehab, where necessary. Storm Recovery Loans may have up to a 30-year term. CPC's portion of the loan will have a rate of approximately 4.5%, and HPD's funds have an interest rate of 1%, for a blended rate below other conventional financing. <br><br>All projects must comply with HPD standard specifications and substantial rehab projects must achieve Enterprise Green Communities Certification. In keeping with NYC's Greener Greater Buildings Plan, all of the properties financed under this program will be benchmarked for energy usage and retrofit for energy savings will be included in their scopes of work. All buildings burning number 6 oil will be converted to comply with the City's Clean Heat initiative.
