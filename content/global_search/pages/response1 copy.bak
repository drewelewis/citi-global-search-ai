In identifying and evaluating these future technologies, we also put together a basic investor framework that evaluates the potential for each technology by asking some simple questions — things like “Is there a specific regulatory driver?” or “Is it reasonably affordable to consumers?” The next chapter in the series expands from a content-into-the-car theme into a new-economics-of the car-itself theme. Fully autonomous cars, driverless on-demand ridesharing networks, and eventually integrated mobile networks, connectivity, over-the-air, and big data are areas being pursued by automakers because of potentially game-changing business model economics.",

Artificial intelligence has been there since decades but has gained traction recently. Mike believes easier jobs that involve tedious work can be automated and simplified using AI which could free up a lot of time/energy to do high-quality tasks. Mike finds Microsoft Co-Pilot interesting because it can summarize meetings and highlights action points mentioned on a call acting as an active assistance tool. So AI is essentially set to free up time for mundane/repetitive tasks for more high value output.",

Pascal believes AI like other general purpose technologies is initially slow to adopt/disrupt and then becomes very disruptive and sees mass adoption on finding relevant use-cases. AI won’t replace jobs but change jobs as it will free up a lot of time/energy that goes into performing mundane/repetitive tasks. Pascal thinks theoretical use-cases of AI could be overhyped/oversold and suggests AI use-cases in finance should be around text analysis, summarization, knowledge mining, content generation etc. and build gradually from there. Moreover, generative AI needs to be in control of humans for fact-checking as it can creates facts on its own.",

Until now crypto gaming weren’t fun and mainstream gamers disliked the financialization of the ecosystem. Ryan believes, in the next 12-18 months Asian gaming studios (especially Korean) will likely launch Web3 games and the trend will be followed by Western AAA-gaming studios. Globally there are over 3bn gamers, largely casual gamers. Ryan expects 100-150 million gamers, largely the ‘whales’, could move to Web3 games in the next few years, and this could bring an inflection point in gaming overall.

Phil believes chip/compute, deep-learning, public blockchain networks and storage are crucial pieces of infrastructure for the Metaverse and that we need a single killer Metaverse use-case (e.g. real-time foreign language translation) similar to media for iPod and step-counting for Fitbit, which transformed into products such as the iPhone and the Apple Watch.

Sovereign ownership of data/assets is the critical layer for an Open Metaverse as asset ownership (car, home, etc. in real economy) and data creates network effects, but today we’re digitally colonized by Web2 platforms for convenience. For Yat, the Metaverse is not just AR/VR but could be anything that involves interfacing virtually e.g. we spend hours on mobile phones and other screens for work, social, entertainment. However, Yat expects that the Metaverse interface tech is likely evolve faster than it did for video games because far more economic opportunities are attached with the Metaverse and also that the DAOs will help protect these virtual communities from social downsides (e.g. harassments, explicit content, etc.).",

Today, according to Paul, about 10% of all banking activity has moved to the cloud but only 1% of core banking system are migrated to cloud, which makes the space ripe for rapid transformation in the next 3-5 years. Regulators, initially cautious, are now increasingly supportive of cloud services for banks and see the benefits of scale, innovation, competition etc. for end-consumers. Thought Machine being 100% cloud native believes it separates itself from incumbent bank IT vendors and offers horizontal scalability, automated/fast deployment and zero downtime.

It encompasses economic, social, cultural, and political elements and is inherently interwoven with a lack of fundamental human rights. According to the UN, its manifestations include hunger and malnutrition, inequality, social discrimination and exclusion, deprivation, inadequate access to education and basic services, as well as lack of participation in decision-making.

However, this extraordinary investment-orientedness is about to end and China’s rebalancing will shift the economy away from investment spending and towards consumer spending and likely come along with weaker growth. This could create a number of threats for emerging markets and the severity of the threat will depend largely on whether the rebalancing process is benign (more consumption) or not (less investment). Our analysis suggests that Asia is the best-placed region to take advantage of a new pattern of Chinese growth, while South America could face a painful adjustment process given the appreciation of real exchange rates that the region has seen in its membership of the ‘China-commodities complex’.",

Our forecasts are a little below the consensus and IMF forecasts (the IMF expects global growth of 2.9% in 2013 and 3.5% in 2014 at current exchange rates). But, we do expect modest near-term growth to give way to faster expansion subsequently, with real global GDP growth of 3½%-4% year-on-year in 2015-17 (although our forecasts for later years also are a bit below the IMF’s). Against this backdrop, major central banks probably will continue to keep policy loose in the near-term, and generally loosen further in 2013, with tightening not likely until 2015 in the US and rather later in Europe and Japan.",

Since the renminbi is not a fully functioning global currency, the BRI largely requires dollar-denominated financial resources to fulfill its objectives: it is significant that the major financing announcements made to kick-start the BRI in 2014 — recapitalizations of the China Development Bank, China Export-Import Bank, as well as new capital for Silk Road Fund, the AIIB, and the New Development Bank — were all made in dollars.

The driving factors behind this change have included the very real impact of globalization and technology on trade and employment, and also the transition of the formerly Communist bloc in Eastern Europe. In very simple terms, globalization has been a positive force in leveling inter-country inequality over the past 30 years.

What if interest rates fall and keep falling until they’re below zero? Would you save your money in a bank if you had to pay them instead of them paying you?",

Investment levels (as a % of GDP) trail those seen prior to the Great-Recession despite “once-in-a-generation” low levels for global interest rates. Without stronger investment to spur a broad-based sustainable recovery, the likelihood of raising productivity to support higher wages and incomes diminishes, as do hopes for more robust long-term growth. In response, economic policy makers have geared up with new approaches and policy tools. Unfortunately “no good deed goes unpunished,” as the unintended consequences of recent policy actions may have inadvertently worsened investment prospects. Substantial empirical evidence suggests that investment has been weakened by policy-induced uncertainty stemming from the dizzying array of monetary, fiscal, and regulatory policy measures implemented since the crisis.",

Its rival, Vivendi, effectively lost control of the board by winning only one- third of the seats, despite owning 24% of Telecom Italia and being backed by the current popular CEO. It was a close win in a widely-watched shareholder battle. Unsurprisingly, the battle was full of mutual accusations of corporate governance failings and inconsistent communication. Some papers characterized the battle as a fight for the future of modern capitalism. Vivendi focused on stability and its alignment with the current CEO. Meanwhile, Elliott managed to secure support of the leading proxy advisors on corporate governance grounds.

In order to significantly decrease unemployment, more reform is needed but labor market reforms alone will not solve the euro area job crisis and have little hope of bringing unemployment down quickly.

A recovery in consumer spending looks likely in the second half of the year as we bounce back from the current lockdowns, but we need to get people back to work before we can be confident of a sustained increase in consumption trends.

Globally, the pace of public activist campaigns in 2013 is on track to exceed that of prior years. In the U.S., almost one-sixth of companies in the S&P 1500 since 2006 have faced a public shareholder activism campaign, with some of these experiencing multiple campaigns. Outside the U.S., shareholder activism has a foothold in the UK and is also gaining some traction in other regions. Moreover, there are a significant number of activist investors in every market who primarily engage with target companies behind closed doors. This is particularly the case in Europe, where research on activism suggests that nearly 45% of all campaign activity is private.

As the most severe effects of the virus start to lift in China, life is beginning to get back to ‘normal’ and some sense on what that new normal looks like is starting to be apparent. One major trend during the crisis was that the government lockdown changed the way consumers acted with more people transacting online out of necessity. One question for the future in China and one that will likely also become relevant in other regions, is whether the crisis has accelerated the trend for online transactions, or whether the increase was a short-term solution to ‘stay-at-home’ mandates.
