By providing multi-year, unrestricted grant support, the Citi Foundation's <a href=\"https://www.citifoundation.com/citi/foundation/programs/community-progress-makers-fund.htm\">Community Progress Makers Fund</a> helped our organization develop the evidence and business case to dramatically increase clean energy investments in low-income communities. But it's more than that. The Fund is an innovative approach to grant-making that pushes organizations to transform the world by first transforming <em>themselves</em>. Elevate Energy seized this unique opportunity to grow from an organization that focuses on program implementation to an organization that uses its on-the-ground, practical experience to help influence and inform energy policy in partnership with other leaders. In other words, the Community Progress Makers Fund helped us move from being a \"doer\" to being an \"influencer.\" We know that many of our nonprofit peers could likewise benefit from this kind of funding model and urge other foundations to consider similar approaches.<strong>A Traditional Focus on Program Implementation</strong><br>Elevate Energy helps the most vulnerable people save money on a basic need, energy, by pairing data-driven strategies with community engagement to deliver programs that lower energy costs, protect people and the environment, and ensure the benefits of clean and efficient energy use reach those who need them most. Elevate Energy is based in Chicago but also has a presence in eight other cities nationwide. Since our founding seventeen years ago, we have served more than 100,000 families and saved consumers more than $55 million on energy bills. Energy-saving improvements in buildings have created 536 construction jobs, generated $64 million in energy efficiency investments, and reduced greenhouse gas emissions by nearly 86,000 metric tons.",

Initially beginning as an opportunity for service members to find discounts at their favorite retailers, the holiday has now expanded to include all consumers. But the retail industry's support of veterans goes well beyond a sales event that honors our country's military by providing our veterans with career opportunities and resources once their service concludes. As a 24-year veteran of the U.S. Army, where I served three combat tours in Iraq and as a national security policy advisor in three White House administrations, I have seen firsthand how today's military veterans can continue to serve our Nation. For veterans to provide such continued service though, they need their fellow citizens to help them transition from military to civilian life, and retailers proudly provide that bridge. As a Managing Director in our Citi Retail Services organization and in particular supporting our Macy's partner, I am inspired and amazed by all of the work our retail partners and fellow Citi colleagues do to help veterans and military families.",

Variables including policy changes, budget cuts, and local crises constantly impact how (and how <em>well</em>) community-based organizations can respond. While we need all the help we can get, some philanthropic support can be prescriptive and overly restrictive about our approach and how we define success. To truly accelerate progress, nonprofits need support in a form that encourages us to adapt to external shifts and develop new ways of addressing long-standing issues. The Citi Foundation's Community Progress Makers Fund helped us do just that. The $20 million, multi-year initiative provided unrestricted grant support to 40 nonprofits in six U.S. cities, enabling a variety of organizations to pilot innovative solutions, increase their ability to secure additional investment, build their organizational capacity and attract new community partners. The Citi Foundation is looking for the next 40 Community Progress Makers. <em>Eligible organizations can apply <a href=\"https://www.citifoundation.com/citi/foundation/programs/community-progress-makers-fund.htm\">here</a> by <strong>December 18, 2017</strong>.</em>",

For over a decade, we've marked this day of service around the world by donating our time, skills and expertise to make a positive impact in the communities where we live and work. Side by side with our community partners, we will once again help tackle a range of pressing challenges in our cities, from feeding the hungry to prepping young people for job interviews to planting trees on a neighborhood block. Last year, I helped one of our <a href=\"https://www.citifoundation.com/citi/foundation/programs/pathways-to-progress.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-link-source=\"tiny\"><em>Pathways to Progress</em></a> youth experience the joy (and wobble) of a new bike, which I assembled with my family at Citi Field. This year, I'm looking forward to another chance to help make a difference.</p>",

The growing trend of urbanization is having an unprecedented impact on the need for infrastructure – whether it is transport, water and sewer, digital or social. By 2030, the world's urban population is projected to increase to 4.9 billion people, roughly 60% of the world's population. China, India and the United States will have the largest number of urban dwellers in the world. Infrastructure is critical to creating economic development, attracting talent, making cities more livable, and helping cities transition to a smarter, more sustainable future, yet not enough projects are moving forward to meet the need.",

This culminated in suggestions to set up a local entrepreneurship magazine, a purchase aggregation service, and a combined mentorship and supply chain management program. Perhaps most importantly, this exercise made us think deeply about what transferable skills we possess that would be most helpful to small businesses here.",

These organizations include the Multilateral Development Bank, public sector, textile industry, agribusiness, communication services, energy and the Correspondent Bank.<br><br>Our franchise has subsidiaries in Honduras' two largest cities: Tegucigalpa, the nation's capital and seat of government, situated on the center of the country, and San Pedro Sula, the nation's business and industrial center, located in the north, near the Atlantic coast.<br><br>One of our top priorities is to make the communities in which we operate a great place to live. Through the Citi Foundation, we allocate significant resources to support organizations that focus on the environment and on those less fortunate, and we encourage our employees and partners to get involved. Over the past 50 years, we've been privileged to work with many admired organizations across several critical areas, including financial education and entrepreneurship training for youth, business development, leadership skills training for women, and care and education for at-risk children.",

Each time a player on a court or a fan in our Citi Booth served over a designated speed, Citi made a monetary donation to the WTEF to support essential year-round academic and athletic programs. Fans lined up at the Booth and players served up speed balls and we proudly donated $50,000 to the WTEF at the end of the tournament.<br><br>Citi also hosted \"Citi Kids\", an educational and motivational program which provided the opportunity for the WTEF kids to meet pro-tennis players to learn about their career successes and challenges, as well as talk about important life lessons such as financial responsibility.

      "summary": "On Global Community Day, Citi will work with nonprofit organizations to strengthen communities around the world through volunteerism. This year, Citi Volunteers worked with Citi Foundation partner INJAZ UAE (Junior Achievement Worldwide) to teach kids the value of personal finance. <br><br><strong>1. What is the need that you see your organization filling? </strong> <br><br>Financial Literacy education in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) is an area that's increasingly gaining momentum, yet educators do not have the programs or infrastructure to provide their students with best practices, activities in this area, nor do they have regular access to mentors that can help in their efforts. Students that don't have access to financial literacy education are therefore lacking in such skills, as most available programs address higher age groups, which is too late for developing the right mindset from an early age. <br><br>INJAZ works with educators to address these issues and support educational development in the UAE. The implementation of financial literacy programs at a young age has a positive social and economic impact, because the earlier that youth learn financial skills, the more likely they'll make better economic decisions in the future. <br><br><strong>2. What opportunity does your organization give volunteers? </strong> <br><br>INJAZ UAE, as any Junior Achievement branch around the world, connects volunteer mentors with youth to share their knowledge with those who need guidance the most, teaching critical learning skills in entrepreneurship, work-readiness and financial literacy skills. This helps bridge the gap between education and the professional world in a practical way. By supporting youth development such skills, will give them first-hand training at a young age, which is a true investment in the development of their future as employees, customers, and business leaders. <br><br>Corporate volunteers have the opportunity to give back to the communities in which they live in by sharing their knowledge and experience with youth, while also gaining skills themselves as they engage with their mentees. <br><strong><br>3. How does your organization have a positive impact on program participants and the greater community? </strong> <br><br>INJAZ UAE helps improve student's career prospects and competitiveness as a result of improved knowledge and skills after they experience JA programs. <br><br>INJAZ UAE gives local and multi-national companies the opportunity to be directly involved in organized CSR activities at a corporate and individual level so companies see the impact they're creating right away. Such programs also support government Emiratisation and the opens the minds of youth to the world of opportunities available in the private sector. <br><br>This successful model, brings companies closer to communities they operate in, giving them an opportunity to take an active role in raising students' knowledge and skills, access to mentors and receptiveness to volunteer work. <br><br><strong>What are the long-term goals of your organization? </strong> <br><br>On each given day, INJAZ UAE delivers volunteer led programs that empower young people to own their economic success. The organization's guiding principles worldwide help achieve its overall purpose which is to inspire and prepare young people to succeed in a global economy. <br><br>Those guiding principles help guide us towards long-term goals, such as delivering highly enjoyable and practical activity based learning programs to improve young people's understanding of the economy and of the necessary skills they will need to succeed in their lives. <br><br>In the UAE, we currenly reach 8000 a year engaging a little over 1300 corporate mentors. We aspire to grow that number each year and increase the impact of our programs. <br><br><strong>4. How is your organization getting involved with Citi's Global Community Day this year? </strong> <br><br>We are very happy to be part of the MENA (Middle East North Africa) for Children Initiative, which delivers programs to support the development of children, in partnership with Citi. In the UAE, Citi volunteers took part in the Personal Economic Program that offers 8 Grade students practical introduction to personal finance. In Morocco, the initiative is centered on youth in rural areas, in which Citi volunteers will be mentoring a group of students in the Brouj area.",

      "summary": "To celebrate Global Community Day this year, Citi employees are sharing stories that have inspired them to make a lasting impact on their communities. Nedjma Benbouzid, Corporate Communications Manager, MENA, Citi, shares her experience teaching young children the importance of financial empowerment. Read her story below: <br><br><strong>What is the need you saw in your city that drove you to volunteer? </strong> <br><br>Like every country in the world, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was affected by the global economic downturn on both a corporate and personal level. After witnessing the damage that over-indebtedness had on people's lives, I wanted to do something to help. I realized that it is critical to teach the next generations the merits of balanced spending and income management, and recognized a specific need to teach young girls about financial empowerment given the growing trend of women's economic independence in this part of the world. <br><br><strong>How did you serve your local community? </strong> <br><br>I participated with fellow Citi colleagues in the Personal Economics program organized by INJAZ Al -Arab. The program provides 12 to 15-year-old students a hands-on, practical introduction to personal finance, credit and debt, savings and investments, and budgeting. Through role play activities, we helped the students prepare for job interviews and learn about pay slips, checks, deposits, earnings and expense management. <br><br><strong>What are you most proud of from your volunteering experience?</strong> <br><br>The energy and enthusiasm of this group of girls helped me feel like I had successfully communicated how important goal setting and financial planning are to their personal success. Listening to them share their dreams of being doctors, traveling, getting married or studying space, and how they now understand the role a financial plan plays in achieving these dreams, was a very rewarding experience. <br><br><strong>What advice would you give to someone who wanted to start volunteering in their community? </strong> <br><br>I would tell them to: <br>• Be curious about initiatives around you. <br>• Do it. Don't delay otherwise you will never do it. <br>• Be humble and don't step in as teacher or truth owner. <br>• Be committed. Once you agree to take part in a volunteering project don't withdraw at the last minute. <br><br><strong>In what ways do you think volunteering makes a difference? </strong> <br><br>The importance of volunteering is that it conveys a strong message that \"everyone counts.\" When someone volunteers his/her skills, there is a considerable added value service that positively impacts the community. <br><br>I believe that volunteer programs that help low income and youth segments of society adopt positive financial behavior and disciplined money management practices will translate into the creation of small enterprises and a better equipped workforce, which both contribute to the foundation of a sustainably developed community. <br><strong><br>What organization will/did you volunteer with for this year's Global Community Day? </strong> <br><br>This year, I joined over 2000 employees in 11 countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region to help support children in our communities. Our volunteer work included answering basic needs (clothing, games, electronics etc.) and educational needs (training, books donations, school stationery).",

Mei Yang, a Citi volunteer and Financial Planning Analyst at Citi, shares her experience cleaning up parks and planting trees in Mississauga, Toronto. Read her story in the Q&amp;A below: <br><br><strong>Why did you decide to volunteer at the local parks in Mississauga? </strong> <br>Mississauga has been home to our Citi office, as well as my family's home for a long time, and I wanted to give back. Through our efforts, we create better environments, healthier communities, and brighter lives. Volunteer work makes us feel good, builds self-confidence and lifts up spirits. <br><br><strong>How did you serve your local community? </strong> <br>To support the community, we have taken part in many activities, such as planting and mulching trees, painting garbage cans, and picking up litter. Working with a large group of people to accomplish these organized activities on a regular basis allows us to have a huge, lasting impact on our community. <br><br><strong>What was the impact of the support you gave? </strong> <br>The best part of cleaning up a park or planting new trees is to see the effect it can have on the environment and in the community. It is a great feeling to walk through a park on a clean path and see the improvement that comes from cooperation and teamwork. I can't imagine how great a feeling it would be to come back to a park in 20 years and see a tree sapling I planted grow into a large tree. <br><br><strong>What are you most proud of from your volunteering experience? </strong> <br>I am extremely proud of not only the physical appearance of the environment, but also the time spent with my son doing something that benefits our entire community. Citi's Global Community Day has always been a fun event for my family and I know it will be for the years to come. <br><br><strong>What advice would you give to someone who wanted to start volunteering in their community?</strong> There are many areas in the city you live that can be improved through different types of volunteer work, so I would advise new volunteers to go ahead and do something they personally enjoy. <br><br><strong>In what ways do you think volunteering makes a difference? What kind of value do you believe it adds to enabling progress in your city?</strong> I believe that volunteering is one of the most important things a citizen can do in their lives, not only because of the improvements in the community, but also the personal gain it provides. It feels great knowing that I have done something that will benefit the lives of my neighbors. The importance of volunteers cannot be understated because so many different events, organizations, etc. are only possible because of the volunteers that serve. <br><strong><br>What organization will you volunteer with for this year's Global Community Day? </strong> <br>In the past, we have done our events in collaboration with municipal institutions focused on environmental causes. This year I'll be volunteering on a park clean up event in the City of Mississauga.",

One of our partners is the City of Mississauga Parks and Forestry. Hazel McColl, Parks Program Coordinator, talks about the Mississauga Parks Community Stewardship Program and partnership with Citi and the Citi Foundation. <br><br><strong>What is the need that you see your organization filling? </strong> <br><br>Mississauga has more than 522 parks, 225 km of trails and woodlands to be maintained and preserved. With more than 2.1 million trees located on public and private land, Mississauga's urban forest is a valuable asset. The Mississauga Parks Community Stewardship Program (PCSP) has been established as a way for volunteers to enhance city parks, natural areas and open spaces. <br><br><strong>Why is what you do important to enabling progress within cities? </strong> <br><br>Our program enables progress by educating volunteers about the value of city parks and how they can contribute to the health and longevity of public spaces. Volunteers are given the opportunity to achieve the following: <br>•Learn about our native trees and shrubs and how to plant them <br>•Get neighbors together and build community spirit <br>•Improve the health of your community <br>•Learn about the benefits of trees <br>•Give back to the environment <br>•Enjoy the outdoors <br><br><strong>How is the work you are doing important to making cities better communities to live in?</strong> <br><br>An urban forest is a fundamental component of a healthy city and sustainable community. The City's One Million Trees Mississauga Program, which was launched as part of the City of Mississauga's Strategic Plan, is an important community engagement activity. This program will help green our city and create a great environmental legacy. It is an opportunity for environmentally conscious and community-minded citizens to make a personal contribution to the quality of life in the city. <br><br>Mississauga also has four community gardens, shared spaces where people come together to grow plants, friendships and community. <br><br><strong>In what ways have you worked with community organizations in your impact efforts? </strong> <br><br>As a municipality, the City of Mississauga partners closely with schools, businesses, community groups, and individuals who are invited to volunteer with our tree planting programs hosted throughout the year. <br><br><strong>What has been the impact of your work and how does volunteering add value? </strong> <br><br>The City of Mississauga is very proud and values its partnership with Citi over the past years. Through community engagement projects, volunteers from corporations are brought into the parks in a different way than what they are used to. Volunteers are needed to plant and maintain trees, improve trails, and remove invasive plants. <br><br>By engaging the community they get a better sense of parks and take pride in what they have accomplished. To date, 98,480 trees planted by individuals, businesses, schools, homeowners and community groups have contributed to the 1 million tree goal. <br><strong><br>What are the long-term goals of your organization? </strong> <br><br>In Mississauga, there are 2.1 million trees on both public and private lands, and the goal is to add one million more over the next 20 years. <br><br>To help fight the battle against litter in Mississauga, the city is targeting the problem by changing attitudes and creating \"litter consciousness\" through programs like \"Don't be a Litterbug.\" <br><br><strong>How is your organization getting involved with Citi's Global Community Day this year? </strong> <br><br>This year, Citi volunteers will once again improve the City of Mississauga with a variety of activities at Meadow Wood Park, including trail maintenance, tree planting, mulching/tree maintenance.",

Working in groups large and small in the cities around the world where we have a presence, these volunteers will work with our local partners, using their time, skills and expertise to improve their communities. <br><br>Global Community Day is an opportunity to witness the difference that Citi volunteers are making on issues that are important to them and to their cities - from housing to the environment to education. As we approach June 7, we will feature stories on this blog from colleagues and community partners on the impact that volunteerism has on our communities, and why active corporate engagement is an essential component of a livable city. <br><br>According to the Corporation for National &amp; Community Service, volunteers in the United States alone served 7.9 billion hours in 2012. Researchers at John Hopkins University estimate that one billion volunteers each year contribute the equivalent of more than $1.3 trillion globally in public service. As urban centers swell in population, volunteers will continue to play a vital role in meeting the diverse, sometimes competing, and always growing needs of city residents. <br><br>In the coming days, you can read more about how volunteerism is a proud tradition at Citi, and you can join the conversation on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram by following <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?f=realtime&amp;q=%23citivolunteers&amp;src=typd\">#CitiVolunteers</a>.",

The beneficiaries of this program show courage and determination, despite having few skills, and have achieved the following amazing results: <br><br>1. <strong>Spending Management Skills</strong>: The beneficiaries learn to detect superficial expenses, reduce unnecessary consumption, and spend only on needs that fit within the family budget. They are taught price comparison skills so that they know how to search for cheapest prices. After the program, they report better income management and an improved quality of life for their families. <br><br>2. <strong>Income Generation Initiatives</strong>: Participants strengthen their self-confidence and realize their potential for success. After these sessions, several businesses are born, some individually and some collectively among groups of women. <br><br>3. <strong>Development Saving Habits</strong>: Many participants don't have the ability or the interest to use financial products and services that promote saving. Thanks to the program, there have been significant steps in developing saving habits, with beneficiaries reported to be saving between 5% and 10% of their income. <br><br>On a whole, I believe my experience with the Banamex Financial Education program has shown the leadership and determination of women.. I continue to feel pride for these women, who remain strong and creative in the face of adversity. . Each day, they transform limitations into opportunities, showing the ability to survive, live and create opportunities for themselves and their families. Their example is an inspiration and a great motive to continue my work",

      "summary": "It's estimated that there is <a href=\"https://www.mckinsey.com/insights/energy_resources_materials/giving_us_energy_efficiency_a_jolt\">$1 trillion in cost savings</a> currently locked up in the form of inefficient appliances, furnaces, water heaters and other energy-wasting parts of our built environment. We have a tremendous untapped opportunity to create jobs and invest in our communities and cities today by making energy efficiency upgrades in our homes. By using more efficient appliances and other easy-to-implement solutions, the average household stands to save <a href=\"https://www.energy.gov/articles/askenergysaver-answering-your-home-energy-saving-questions\">nearly $400 per year</a>. <br><br><strong>While the potential savings from changes are great, the barriers are high</strong>. The cost of the average residential energy efficiency improvement project is $8,000 to $10,000. The opportunity to make improvements usually surfaces as a result of an emergency: a furnace, water heater or air conditioning system fails and either needs to be repaired quickly or be replaced with the more costly option of an energy-efficient unit. <br><br>Most of us haven't saved enough to do such costly upgrades. In these emergency situations, we simply need the problem fixed--there's no time to wait to see if we can get a loan for an energy-saving upgrade. So we continue with the status quo, and - as an unintended result - we keep wasting power. <br><br><strong>But the status quo is changing.</strong> Kilowatt Financial is making clean energy and energy efficiency upgrades convenient and accessible through fast, low-cost financing. Kilowatt is a startup that leverages deep experience in consumer finance with a desire to \"crack the energy efficiency code\" and unlock the demand for more residential solar power and energy efficiency improvements. <br><br>Kilowatt has created algorithms to speed up the homeowner credit approval process for both energy efficiency upgrades and solar panel installation. Working through an approved contractor, in over 80% of cases a homeowner can get a credit answer within fifteen seconds. That, combined with low-cost capital, helps residents tap their share of the estimated $1 trillion in cost savings available from energy efficiency upgrades. <br><strong><br>Warehouse debt facility and securitization help from Citi spur progress.</strong> \"We recently closed a $100 million warehouse debt facility with Citi,\" says Kilowatt Chairman and CEO Dan Pillemer. \"It allows us to lend at a very competitive cost, but with great flexibility and fast response to consumers and contractors. Homeowner energy efficiency improvements have historically been difficult to finance because of the small scale of individual projects and the need for fast, accurate credit decisions. This facility from Citi helps us remove those barriers, and grow.\" <br><br>The financing provided by Citi is a first for consumer-oriented energy improvements. Marshal Salant, Head of Alternative Energy Finance at Citi notes, \"The move is significant not just because it is a first, but because it enables securitization of this market. Institutions such as pension funds and insurance companies will now be able to invest in this area, where before they have lacked opportunities due to scale.\" <br><br>Kilowatt Financial has already helped more than 20,000 households finance energy efficiency improvements or convert to solar power. To date, that is the equivalent of taking almost 8,300 cars off the roads, and keeps 39,000 metric tons of carbon out of the atmosphere. With the new debt facility and securitization made possible by Citi, Kilowatt Financial is accelerating its progress, and making our communities, cities and the environment cleaner and safer.",

Currently, I serve as a Relationship Associate on Citi's Real Estate Risk Management team within the Institutional Client Group. <br><br>Looking back on my career - and more specifically, where it began - I can identify certain skills and qualities that have proven beneficial to my professional development: Skills including people and business operations management, and qualities such as the hunger to constantly evolve and never settle for business as usual. <br><br>Growing up, my parents owned Freddie's Record and Video Store, a small business in my hometown of Plainfield, NJ. Following a family tragedy that occurred when I was 13, I began working at the store every evening after school and all day on Saturdays. <br><br>Like with any business, there was a steep learning curve and, as someone who was new to the workforce, I made my fair share of mistakes. Working for my immediate family made the experience even more challenging as they had high expectations of what I was capable of doing. When I first started, I was responsible for working the register and assisting customers with video rentals, but as I got older and became more knowledgeable I started to run the store on my own. During this time, I learned key lessons, such as how to operate a business and make intelligent decisions about loss prevention, marketing and staffing. <br><br>Above all, the single greatest lesson I learned was about people. No matter what you do or where you work, people management is a skill worth developing as you will always have clients with specific wants and needs. In my current role as a Relationship Associate, I am responsible for supporting the credit officers in meeting the Real Estate Commercial Loan Portfolio client needs. This involves managing relationships with key stakeholders, and liaising between customers, bankers and risk managers as well as the rest of Citi across various regions and business units. <br><br>Through my first job, I was able to see first-hand what it is like to own and operate a business, including the reality of work-life balance, the importance of a strong work ethic and how to handle difficult situations. When you own your own business there are no sick days. Your livelihood depends on your ability to show up and do the best that you can, and you have to be able and willing to take advantage of every opportunity to further your goals. <br><br>While my family was tough on me, there is no question that they were by far the most influential in helping shape my career. Through them, I learned early on that being complacent with business as usual is not going to serve you for very long. <br><br>In my role today, I find that these lessons still apply, and I hope you find value from them, whether you work for yourself, a family member or a global organization such as Citi.",

      "summary": "Innovation has led to incredible advances in technology, which have changed the way we work and live. Dynamic tech hubs have been established in cities around the world, stretching from Silicon Valley, San Francisco and Seattle, to Austin, Chicago, New York City and Boston, to Vancouver, London, Sao Paulo and beyond. <br><br>But how should we define and measure the tech economy? Along with Google, the Association for a Better New York and the NY Tech Meetup, Citi commissioned a first-of-its-kind study to measure the impact of tech jobs on New York City's economy. The <a href=\"https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/140401CitiGoogleNYCTechReport.pdf\">report</a> was just released and it contains some fascinating conclusions. <br><br><strong>The Tech Economy - Not the Tech Sector </strong> <br><br>Instead of the traditional definition of looking only at tech jobs in tech industries (for instance, an engineer at Google), the report considers the entire \"ecosystem\" of tech positions in New York City. This ecosystem includes non-tech jobs in tech industries (a sales rep at Etsy) as well as tech jobs in non-tech industries (a web developer or social media specialist at Citi). <br><br>An estimated 291,000 people work in the overall NYC tech ecosystem, which is 7% of the city's workforce. More than half of them - 150,000 - work at non-tech firms. This proves that tech jobs are infused throughout the city's diverse economy, from financial services and media to retail and fashion. In other words, in a sense, we should not think about tech as a separate sector, but as critical to the success and growth of the entire economy. <br><br>In many ways, Citi serves as the perfect example of this framework. Of the nearly 17,000 Citi employees in New York City, an estimated 1,860 - approximately 11% - work in tech-related occupations. And we have thousands of employees around the world who implement technology - from making sure we can communicate internally, to creating new mobile and tablet apps or a new ATM experience - to make sure we can serve our clients, who are increasingly connected digitally. <br><br><strong>Jobs, Education and Succeeding in the 21st Century Economy</strong> <br><br>The report also shows that 44% of tech jobs in New York City don't require a Bachelor's degree and they pay a higher-than-average wage. The report recommends that the city create workforce development programs that provide training in the skills required to attain good tech jobs, and expand efforts to support computer literacy and technical programs in the city's primary education system. <br><br>As cities push to become even more digital and embrace the tech ecosystem, we hope this study and its revelations provide useful insight. Tech will continue to be a core part of a diverse economy. Those cities that recognize and support this trend will enjoy a competitive advantage in the years to come. <a href=\"https://www.citigroup.com/rcs/citigpa/storage/public/140401CitiGoogleNYCTechReport.pdf\">View Report. </a>",

The Citi ThankYou® Home Runs for Communities Program began yesterday (March 31) during the Mets' Opening Day game and will operate through the last regular season home game (September 28) at Citi Field.",

      "summary": "Here in the United States, job creation efforts continue to struggle for traction, and the youth unemployment rate - at its highest level since World War II - remains a significant concern. Too often, young men and women are facing barriers to finding entry-level positions, preventing them from accessing critical launch-pads into the professional world. <br><br>We believe early-career workplace experience, civic engagement, and the development of an entrepreneurial mindset are each integral to helping the next generation build stronger futures for themselves, their families and their communities. That belief forms the foundation for Pathways to Progress, an ambitious three-year, $50 million initiative that builds upon the Citi Foundation's ongoing efforts to empower young Americans and connect them with opportunities to succeed. <br><br>Pathways to Progress, which represents the single largest commitment in the Citi Foundation's 20-year history, will provide career training to 100,000 low-income youth ages 16 to 24, with a focus on ten of the largest U.S. cities where we have a presence. By helping young people start small businesses, develop an entrepreneurial mindset that employers seek, and secure summer jobs, the initiative aims to put them on a career path that improves their opportunities to advance professionally and economically. <br><br>Citi has a long tradition of enabling urban progress and strengthening communities in cities where we operate. We are building upon this track record through the Pathways to Progress campaign by partnering with civic leaders - including U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan, U.S. Senator Cory Booker, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, Miami-Dade County Mayor Carlos Gimenez, District of Columbia Mayor Vincent Gray, San Francisco Mayor Ed Lee, Dallas Mayor Mike Rawlings, St. Louis Mayor Francis Slay, and Boston Mayor Martin Walsh - to drive momentum as we implement the initiative. <br><br>Cities are increasingly becoming important testing grounds for innovative socio-economic programming and solutions. And high youth unemployment is an issue that mayors and urban leaders are concerned with not only because of its social implications, but also because of the future economic challenges it presents. <br><br>In addition, we are working hand-in-hand with non-profit partners like Points of Light, Network for Teaching Entrepreneurship, and Cities for Financial Empowerment to reach deep into communities, share important lessons, and maximize the initiative's impact. Collaboration like this is essential as we seek new ways to connect young Americans with opportunities to create rewarding and meaningful livelihoods. <br><br>For more information on Pathways to Progress, please visit the <a href=\"https://www.citifoundation.com/citi/foundation/pathwaystoprogress/\">Citi Foundation website</a>.",
