In the same period, industry demand declined 0.7%, and the collection cycle lengthened by 5.0% \u2014 continuing a nearly two-year trend of law firm clients taking longer to pay bills. Expense pressure remained strong, with total expenses up 4.8% at the nine-month mark, driven by the inflationary pressures on firms\u2019 operating expenses.", "tag-6": "As anticipated in last year\u2019s Client Advisory, practices less dependent on M&A and capital markets work performed better, with litigation, regulatory and investigations, funds/investment management, bankruptcy and restructuring, and intellectual property seeing strong activity. This resulted in a greater decline in demand for Am Law 1-50 firms (1.2% on average) for the first nine months of 2023, while demand levels for other Am Law 200 segments only decreased slightly. Even as demand declined, total lawyer headcount climbed 2.9%, though growth moderated over the course of the year. The high interest rate environment will likely remain in 2024, yet a rebound in transactional practices is anticipated when the market steadies.", "tag-7": "\u201cDespite inflationary pressures and a volatile geopolitical and macroeconomic environment, we continue to observe a stable legal profession that performs better than expected in the toughest of times,\u201d said Brad Hildebrandt, Chairman of Hildebrandt Consulting.", "tag-8": "Talent and technology present both challenges and opportunities for law firms in 2024 and beyond. A war for partner talent continues, as equity partner headcount grew 0.9% in the first nine months of 2023, compared to historically flat growth. Income partners are also increasing over time, with 85% of firms that have income partners increasing this number from 2017\u201322 \u2014 some establishing the income partner category during this time. An ongoing focus on income partner growth is expected, particularly as a retention tool among large, highly profitable firms.", "tag-9": "On the technology front, rapidly developing generative AI captured the attention of the legal industry in 2023. Some firms started experimenting with generative AI while also focusing heavily on identifying the associated risks, with protecting client and firm confidentiality top of mind. While generative AI has not had much impact at this stage, it\u2019s viewed as a positive development for lawyers and another step on the long continuum of lawyers embracing technology to improve the delivery of legal services.", "tag-10": "\u201cFirm leaders continue to maintain a growth mindset and look beyond short-term demand challenges by investing in talent and opportunities to expand,\u201d said Gretta Rusanow, Head of Advisory Services for the Law Firm Group, Citi Global Wealth at Work. \u201cWe\u2019re optimistic that 2024 will be an even stronger year than 2023.\u201d", "tag-11": "Analyses and projections are based on data collected from Citi Global Wealth at Work's sampling of primarily U.S.-headquartered law firms, as well as conversations with law firm leaders.
