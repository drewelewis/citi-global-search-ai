Nearly all of our net income came from our core businesses and we continued to reduce non-core assets in Citi Holdings. We significantly improved our efficiency ratio, return on assets and return on tangible common equity from the first quarter. We also grew loans in both our consumer and institutional businesses, reduced expenses, and utilized additional deferred tax assets, bringing the total utilized to $10 billion over the last four years. This utilization fuels our ability to generate regulatory capital and, with the Fed's non-objection to our capital plan, I am pleased that we will significantly increase the amount of capital returned to our shareholders over the next year.\"", "tag-6": "In the discussion throughout the remainder of this press release, Citigroup's results of operations in the prior year period are presented excluding CVA/DVA, as applicable, for consistency with the current period's presentation (see note 4 to this release).
