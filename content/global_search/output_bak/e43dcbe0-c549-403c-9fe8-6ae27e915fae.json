My thoughts are with everyone affected by the senseless loss of life. I spoke with our colleagues in Israel earlier today. While they are rightfully hurting, their spirit is strong. Most importantly, they are all safe, and we all pray they remain so. I reassured them that we will continue to do what is necessary to support them. I am in awe of their dedication to their clients and each other.", "tag-5": "Many of you have asked how you might help personally; there are a number of relief agencies responding that would welcome your donations. The Citi Foundation will be providing $1 million to humanitarian organizations operating in Israel. Please look out for more details in the coming days.", "tag-6": "Regards,", "tag-7": "Jane Fraser"}
