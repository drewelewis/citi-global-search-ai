Citi retail services revenues of $1.7 billion increased 2%, reflecting continued loan growth. Citi-branded cards revenues of $2.2 billion decreased 1%, as the benefit of growth in full-rate revolving balances in the core portfolios was outpaced by the continued run-off of non-core portfolios as well as the higher cost to fund growth in transactor and promotional balances, given higher interest rates.", "tag-19": "North America GCB net income was $655 million, down 16%, driven by higher cost of credit partially offset by the higher revenues and lower operating expenses.

The net loan loss reserve build in the third quarter 2017 was $460 million, compared to a build of $408 million in the prior year period. The $460 million net build was comprised of a modest reserve release related to the commercial banking business and an approximate build of $500 million related to the cards business.
