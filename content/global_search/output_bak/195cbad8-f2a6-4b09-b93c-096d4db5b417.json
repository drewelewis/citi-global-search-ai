The legislation and regulatory landscape is undergoing rapid changes which could affect Citi's position when considering its investments in certain assets. Citi may re-evaluate its asset pools, and all applicable eligibility requirements in the future following regulatory developments; this is to ensure compliance with legal requirements when qualifying an asset as 'sustainable'.
