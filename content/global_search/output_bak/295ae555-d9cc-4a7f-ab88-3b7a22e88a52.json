This compared to net income of $4.8 billion, or $1.95 per diluted share, on revenues of $18.8 billion for the second quarter 2019.", "tag-5": "Revenues increased 5% from the prior-year period, primarily reflecting higher revenues in Fixed Income Markets and Investment Banking, both in the Institutional Clients Group (ICG), partially offset by lower revenues in Global Consumer Banking (GCB). Net income declined 73% from the prior-year period, driven by substantially higher allowance for credit loss reserves (ACL), primarily reflecting the deterioration in Citi's view of the macroeconomic outlook since the end of the first quarter under the Current Expected Credit Loss standard (CECL), as well as downgrades in the corporate loan portfolio, in both cases driven by the continued impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. The reserve build also includes an additional qualitative management adjustment to reflect the potential for a higher level of stress and/or a somewhat slower economic recovery. Earnings per share of $0.50 decreased 74% from the prior-year period, reflecting the decline in net income.", "tag-6": "Michael Corbat, Citi CEO, said, \"While credit costs weighed down our net income, our overall business performance was strong during the quarter, and we have been able to navigate the COVID-19 pandemic reasonably well. The Institutional Clients Group had an exceptional quarter, marked by an increase in Fixed Income of 68%. Global Consumer Banking revenues were down as spending slowed significantly due to the pandemic.", "tag-7": "\"We entered this crisis from a position of strength. During the quarter, our regulatory capital increased and our CET1 ratio improved to 11.5%, comfortably above our new regulatory minimum of 10%. We continued to add to our substantial levels of liquidity and our balance sheet has plenty of capacity to serve our clients. With a sharp emphasis on risk management, we are prepared for a variety of scenarios and will continue to operate our institution prudently given this unprecedented situation,\" Mr. Corbat concluded.", "tag-8": "Percentage comparisons throughout this press release are calculated for the second quarter 2020 versus the second quarter 2019, unless otherwise specified.", "tag-9": "Citigroup", "tag-10": "Citigroup operating expenses of $10.4 billion in the second quarter 2020 decreased 1%, as efficiency savings and lower marketing and other discretionary spend more than offset higher compensation expense, investments and COVID-19 related expenses.", "tag-11": "Citigroup cost of credit of $7.9 billion in the second quarter 2020 compared to $2.1 billion in the prior-year period, reflecting the ACL builds related to the deterioration in Citi's macroeconomic outlook since the end of the first quarter, the corporate loan downgrades and the qualitative management adjustment.", "tag-12": "Citigroup net income of $1.3 billion in the second quarter 2020 declined 73%, driven by the higher cost of credit, partially offset by the higher revenues and a lower effective tax rate.
