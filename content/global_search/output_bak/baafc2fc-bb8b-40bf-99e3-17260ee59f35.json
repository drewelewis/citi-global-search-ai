However, the reality is that far too many children are experiencing hunger \u2013 a problem that has been exacerbated by the pandemic. The truth is no child should have to worry about where their next meal is coming from.", "tag-3": "Yet the fact remains that today millions of children are living with hunger in the United States. Systematic inequalities have led to disproportionate rates of hunger across communities of color and low-income families. That's why we're committed to investing in organizations that align with Citi's mission of enabling progress in the communities we serve.", "tag-4": "Since 2014, Citi has been a leading partner of Share Our Strength and their No Kid Hungry campaign \u2013 the only national campaign solely focused on ending childhood hunger in America. It remains critical that we continue our work by ensuring children have adequate nutrition and the support they need for a bright future. To date, our investment in No Kid Hungry has helped to provide 290 million meals to kids across America.", "tag-5": "It's been a cause our clients and colleagues, myself included, have been collectively invested in. We've found ways to turn everyday transactions, from swiping your Citi credit card for dining to cheering on sports teams, into millions of meals for kids in need.", "tag-6": "This year, Citi returns as the presenting sponsor at Global Citizen Festival. Global Citizen's vision is a world without extreme poverty by 2030 and the UN Global Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) are a crucial framework and strategy for seeing that vision through. As a global bank committed to enabling growth and progress around the world, we know Citi has a role to play in mobilizing capital to advance progress toward the goals. That's why we joined Global Citizen on its mission a decade ago and recently made a sustainable finance commitment of $1 trillion by 2030. This commitment aligns with the UN's ambitious agenda by furthering the acceleration to a sustainable, low-carbon economy that supports the environmental, social and economic needs of society.", "tag-7": "At this year's Global Citizen Festival, we announced our continuing support of No Kid Hungry with funding, which can help provide 50 million more meals to kids in need over the next three years. And in the spirit of the Global Citizen Festival theme, \"Take Action Now,\" Citi will also donate up to an additional $1 million to No Kid Hungry with the help of festival attendees, viewers and those following on social media. For every social media post or share including #CitiGiving, Citi will donate $10 to No Kid Hungry through September 30, 2022, or until Citi reaches its goal of $1 million.", "tag-8": "We're proud to join in this mission and help enable growth and progress for kids to thrive. I know I want that for my own children, so until the day no one has to worry about putting food on the table, we're committed to helping end hunger. Take action now at nokidhungry.org/Citi"}
