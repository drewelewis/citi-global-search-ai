Major U.S. clients of the Paris branch were Standard Oil, International Harvester, American Radiator and United States Lines. French clients included industrial companies in Lille and silk companies in Lyon. The main sources of income were commercial overdrafts, discounting trade bills, and foreign exchange. Harvey Gerry, who worked in both the Paris and Nice branches between 1931 and 1939, recalled that the bank was very competitive in this market. When German troops invaded France and advanced towards Paris in June 1940, the bank evacuated the branch and relocated to Le Puy, a small town in the mountains of south-central France, which was in the unoccupied zone. \"Cash, securities, and files were transported in a truck,\" Gerry said. \"Books, machines, and personnel were crowded into three other trucks.\" The trip took two days. Of 250 employees, about 50 found their way to Le Puy, where a new branch was set up at the Hotel Bristol, which also provided living quarters for much of the staff. Head office decided to liquidate the French business, although operations in Paris had to be partly resumed to contact those clients who were still in the occupied zone. After the bank had paid indemnities to employees and helped them find new jobs, the number of staff in Le Puy and Paris was progressively reduced to about 20 overall. Before two-way passes between the occupied and unoccupied zones were issued, Gerry recalled that one staff member was said to have crossed German lines in a mailbag."}
