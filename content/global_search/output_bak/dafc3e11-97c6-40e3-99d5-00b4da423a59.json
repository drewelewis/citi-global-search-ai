Once up and running, is expected to provide services to up to 100,000 patients per year. As one of the project's chief financial advisors, our team supported the project's development with services ranging from financial planning to documentation to debt and equity reimbursement negotiations.", "tag-4": "Planning for the project commenced in 2011, with funding and construction beginning in 2015. The campus will serve as a major employer in the region, not just during construction but also in the future. Among the many employment opportunities created for local residents will be 4,700 non-medical staff positions. Additional jobs will be provided by growing local enterprises as patients and visitors flock to Ankara.", "tag-5": "In an emerging market, the development of any innovative new health facility comes with its challenges, and this project was no exception. Yet at the end of the day, Citi's advisory services were instrumental in closing the transaction as well as to the project's widely acknowledged success. Our team is proud of the positive impacts this medical campus will have on the region, in both the short and the long term.", "tag-6": "Our current hope is that this project's timely completion will allow other deals to close, further benefiting the country.
