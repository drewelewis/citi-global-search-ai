She gave me one of the best gifts \u2013 the reality of a successful working mother. She put as much into her meaningful career as a scientist as she did into her family and showed me what was possible.", "tag-3": "Finding work-life harmony is challenging \u2013 and not just for women, though they tend to take on the lion\u2019s share of childcare and household duties. We can all benefit from sharing what\u2019s worked for us, so with two sons now in young adulthood, I want to offer a few pieces of advice that have guided me over the years.", "tag-4": "While there are plenty of other tips and tricks I\u2019ve used throughout the years, these points have helped guide my decisions around how I show up for my team and colleagues each day. And whether you\u2019re a woman, working parent or ally, we can all reflect on how we\u2019re showing up and supporting those around us."}
