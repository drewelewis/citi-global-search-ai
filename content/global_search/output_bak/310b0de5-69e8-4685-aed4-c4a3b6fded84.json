However, the private bank's modern form, as part of the Institutional Clients Group, can be traced back to an initiative by Walter Wriston, who formed the international services division. This merged all units within Citi that managed the financial-planning needs of wealthy individuals. Wriston's commitment to the business and its clientele was legendary. He was even known to have picked up a client or two flying into the airport at New York. These private-client relationships often brought in institutional business for Citi. In 1982, the division became the International Private Bank; and, in 1986, under John Reed, it was transformed into the Private Banking Group, with a business model that fundamentally continues to this day. It was in 1986 that the phrase \"wealth management\" was originally coined, and the decision made to be a private bank, as opposed to a brokerage business. The late 1980s and the 1990s saw rapid expansion to onshore centers from traditional offshore locations, such as Geneva and London, leading to the creation of a truly global private bank."}
