Today, we're sharing what we've done to date to show how Citi is committed to real change, and to be clear and transparent about how far we have to go. We are determined to do everything we can to help close the racial wealth gap in our communities and continue to do the work to become an anti-racist institution.\"", "tag-6": "\"The financial inequality and other systemic problems people of color face will not go away until we confront them head on\u2014and that's what we're working towards here at Citi,\" Mark Mason, Citi CFO, said. \"Citi is focused on ensuring that people of color have the same access to the financial tools and resources that benefit other groups.
