The year 1921 saw the acquisition of the Commercial Exchange Bank, and three domestic branches as part of the bargain. One of these was the 42nd Street branch. Vice president Thomas Reynolds described the new approach to business there: \"We are actively interested in individual accounts, balances of which average $500 or more, and are making a consistent effort to develop this type of business, along with the larger accounts that come from business houses.\" A second acquisition followed in the same year. The merger with Second National Bank, which was founded in 1863 and in which the Stillman family held a controlling interest, brought into the National City Bank network a branch at 28th Street and 5th Avenue. Second National Bank's core client base was the textile and other manufacturers located between 23rd and 34th streets. The year 1924 thus saw National City Bank represented by branches at 42nd Street and Madison Avenue; at 28th Street and 5th Avenue; at the Bowery branch; at 57th Street and 7th Avenue; and at 72nd Street and Amsterdam Avenue. The growth of the network did not stop there. Following a change in the law that allowed national banks to have full-service branches as long as they conformed to state law, by the end of 1929 National City Bank had 37 domestic branches in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, and the Bronx, the fifth-largest domestic branch system in the country. Some of the branches were distinctive architecturally. The Art Deco-style former Canal Street/Broadway branch, which is still standing, was opened in 1927. It is not hard to see a family resemblance between this and its grander cousin in Buenos Aires, opened in 1929. Underlying this domestic expansion was the wish to offer every customer, in the words of the staff magazine Number Eight, \"the same worldwide banking, investment and trust facilities that have been developed at Head Office, 55 Wall Street\" and so make banking \"as simple as buying a dress, a pair of gloves or a piece of furniture.\""}
