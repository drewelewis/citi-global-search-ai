These include an independent supplier categorisation and roadmap framework, which was jointly developed by Vodafone and CDP, a global not-for-profit organisation that runs a global environmental disclosure system. It is hoped that this new programme will encourage suppliers to reduce their carbon footprint and ultimately contribute towards Vodafone meeting its Scope 3 emissions targets.", "tag-5": "The launch comes as Citi continues to roll out sustainable Trade and Working Capital solutions, including Sustainability-linked Supply Chain Finance, as part of its commitment to help clients with solutions to achieve their environmental ambitions.", "tag-6": "\u201cWe are delighted that Vodafone has collaborated with Citi to deliver this sustainability-linked solution for its suppliers.

In using Citi's SCF programme, for example, the bank would provide financing to a client's suppliers from the date of collection of specific goods/provision of services to the date on which payment is owed to these suppliers. The cost of this financing is borne by suppliers at a rate lower than their usual cost of funds. As a result, suppliers benefit from cash flow acceleration, quicker payment and improved financing costs.", "tag-10": "About Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions", "tag-11": "Citi Treasury and Trade Solutions (TTS) enables our clients' success by providing an integrated suite of innovative and tailored cash management and trade finance services to multinational corporations, financial institutions and public sector organizations across the globe.
