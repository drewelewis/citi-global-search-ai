The yearly issuance plan is built around a target level of funding for the entire credit card business to be furnished through securitization. This target level can vary from year to year, but has remained within a range of 5%-20% over the last ten years. Currently, securitization funds approximately 5% of Citibank's U.S. credit card business. The volume of securitization in a calendar year derives from maturing securitizations and portfolio growth and acquisition.", "tag-3": "Each year, a target average maturity of borrowings is determined. The goal is to limit the amount of securities to re-finance at any time, by applying upper limits on the amount of securities maturing in any month, quarter, and year.", "tag-4": "The entire curve is used, from commercial paper out to 30 years. Fixed- and floating-rate securities can be issued, according to investor demand; interest rate exposure decisions are made independently of issuance decisions. Non-USD securities can be issued, but these are swapped back to USD, as the Trust cannot have currency exposure.", "tag-5": "Subordinated securities are offered independently of senior securities (i.e., they are \"de-linked\"), but senior securities cannot be issued if there are insufficient amounts of available subordinated securities outstanding.", "tag-6": "CCCIT, which was introduced in 2000, is the current issuance vehicle out of the Citibank Credit Card Master Trust. CCCIT had outstanding securities totaling $6.1\u00a0billion as of November 30, 2023."}
