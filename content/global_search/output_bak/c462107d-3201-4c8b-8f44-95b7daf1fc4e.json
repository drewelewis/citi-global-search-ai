Despite the long-term nature of that capital, over the past 25 years the amount domestic investors earmarked for equities, and in particular UK companies, has declined dramatically. This is a tragedy twice over, or what a new think-tank report calls \u201cparallel crises.\u201d", "tag-3": "In UK Capital Markets: a new sense of urgency, sponsored by Citi and abrdn, think tank New Financial argues that the UK pension system is in crisis because of excessive fragmentation and low contributions. The second and related crisis is in capital markets. Many UK investors have all but abandoned investment in UK productive assets, leaving the country reliant on overseas investors for growth capital and funding for critical infrastructure, while denying higher returns to tomorrow\u2019s generations of pensioners.", "tag-4": "This situation is costly for all of us who live and work in the UK. Extrapolating OECD figures, a typical UK pension pot might be worth \u00a3140k in today\u2019s money after 35 years, assuming a 4% real rate of return and 3% annual increase in earnings/contributions. In Canada, that same pot would be worth \u00a3176k, given the better performance of the country\u2019s pension funds. In Australia, it would be an even higher \u00a3186k. This means that, on some estimates, poor performance could leave UK savers with \u00a345,000 less in their pension pots than their Australian counterparts.", "tag-5": "The challenges of UK capital markets and pension investing are complex, decades in the making, and the UK Government is to be commended for the energy and focus it is bringing to addressing this long-running issue.", "tag-6": "In framing policy to create new incentives to invest in the companies of the future \u2013 the next Arm Holdings, or a biotech firm to solve previously incurable diseases \u2013 the UK needs to embrace the appropriate balance of risk to deliver inflation-beating returns by encouraging diversification of pension assets at scale.", "tag-7": "Perhaps the greatest opportunity is with defined contribution schemes, the largest collection of UK pension assets, most of which are currently active. There are more than 3,000 defined contribution schemes operating in the UK with about \u00a3600 billion in total assets, or \u00a3200 million each. In Australia, by contrast, there are about 120 \u201csuper\u201d schemes with nearly \u00a310 billion in assets each. Consolidating schemes increases the ability to take appropriately managed and diversified risk, which over time improves returns.", "tag-8": "There are also more than 5,000 defined benefit schemes in the UK, 75% of which have less than \u00a3100 million in assets, too small to achieve economies of scale and the portfolio diversification to invest, at scale, in UK equities. The UK\u2019s superfund regime is currently stalled on the starting grid. The Government should strengthen the incentives for corporate sponsors to transfer fully-funded schemes to new \u201csuperfunds,\u201d which have been successful in Australia, Canada and elsewhere.", "tag-9": "Finally, we could kick-start a new era of retail investment by creating a \u201cchild equity growth fund\u201d for every newborn. This would, I suggest, substantially improve the nation\u2019s financial literacy and engagement with equity investment, valuable goals in themselves. Investing (say) \u00a33,000 for each child would, over 30 years, raise more than \u00a3200 billion of risk capital to fund the high-growth companies of the future.", "tag-10": "The scale of the challenge is substantial, but the opportunity is huge. We are hopeful that this topic remains near the top of the agenda and urge the Chancellor to be bold in his autumn statement.", "tag-11": "Please click on the link to the report here."}
