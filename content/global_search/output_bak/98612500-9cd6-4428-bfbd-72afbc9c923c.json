She cited a report published in 2016 by the Organization of American States (OAS) and Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) that found that four out of five Latin American countries have no cybersecurity strategies or real plans to protect their technological infrastructure, and the overwhelming majority of attorney generals and judiciaries lack the capacity to prosecute IT crimes.", "tag-6": "According to Waleska Alvarez, cyber attacks cost Latin America an estimated $90 million last year, a figure that takes into account only those incidents actually reported and represents four times the amount of funding for scientific research in the region.", "tag-7": "The presenters agreed that the main task facing governments in the region is to create effective laws and regulations to guard against and categorize electronic crime of all types, and train police agents to combat such offenses. \"Cybercrime doesn't stop at the border.
