This gathering is among the largest of its kind in Australasia with over 700 clients, nearly 60 companies, representatives of the media and many high-profile speakers in attendance. By any measure, this year's event was high-profile, with record attendance and first-rate content and discussion. As Head of Markets for Australia and New Zealand, I couldn't be prouder of our broad team's contribution to this important event's success.", "tag-1": "Leaders Gather at 8th Annual Australian & New Zealand Investment Conference to Discuss Global Investment in the Region", "tag-2": "We recently held our 8th annual Australian Investment Conference in Sydney, which brings together domestic and international investors, the CEOs of Australia's leading companies and thought leaders from inside and outside Citi's global network.

Australia has warmly welcomed foreign capital since its founding as a nation, a tradition that helps to ensure that it maintains its position as a high quality destination for foreign investment, which forms one of the bedrock priorities of national economic policy. Now entering its 26th straight year of expansion, Australia ranks near the top globally in per capita income as well as on the HDI (Human Development Index). To those of us fortunate to live and work here, we are often asked if Australia can maintain that track record of steady and consistent growth in the face of a mining boom that has faded and an economy undergoing an even more challenging transition to a broader and more balanced mix of commercial activities. Ultimately, the success of that transformation is likely to depend on a range of global macro and domestic factors, but in an era of what seems to be more turbulent and inwardly-focused politics, we believe that Australia needs to keep selling its story of vast opportunity to an increasingly defensive and uncertain community of global investors.", "tag-4": "Behind this story of inbound investment, however, lies another story, of Australia's more recent evolution into one of the world's largest and most important outbound investors. Australia has built a pension system (\"Superannuation\") that is the envy of many other countries burdened by high government future liabilities and insufficient private retirement savings. Through a long period of mandatory savings (the system is designed around a 9.5% mandatory employer contribution) and high returns, the Australian Superannuation industry is now the 4th largest pension system in the world with over A $2 trillion in assets. That's an extremely impressive performance for a country that ranks outside the top 50 in population, yet it also poses a challenge as the country's domestic stock market is only the 12th largest globally. These pension funds, which manage the future retirement wealth of the nation, are as a result, always on the lookout beyond the continent for long-term returns and asset opportunities that suit their investment objectives. At Citi, we have been increasingly focused on serving this group of clients as we open our global network to them in support of their relentless search for returns.", "tag-5": "To facilitate ongoing global investment both into and from Australia requires that we provide quality and unique content and connectivity on top of our first-rate execution, liquidity and advisory capabilities. As a team, we take our responsibility to support Australia's economic future and deliver value for our clients very seriously. The success of events like the Investment Conference are a testament to the gravity of that commitment."}
