Earnings per share of $2.08 decreased 3% from the prior-year period, primarily reflecting the decline in net income.", "tag-6": "For the full year 2020, Citigroup reported net income of $11.4 billion on revenues of $74.3 billion, compared to net income of $19.4 billion on revenues of $74.3 billion for the full year 2019.", "tag-7": "Michael Corbat, Citi CEO, said, \"We ended a tumultuous year with a strong fourth quarter. As a sign of the strength and durability of our diversified franchise, our revenues were flat to 2019, despite the massive economic impact of COVID-19.

Our CET 1 ratio increased to 11.8%, well above our regulatory minimum of 10%. Our Tangible Book Value per share increased to $73.83, up 5% from a year ago. Given the Federal Reserve decision regarding share repurchases as we have excess capital we can return to shareholders, we plan to resume buybacks during the current quarter.", "tag-9": "\"Looking back, I am proud of the progress the firm has made since I became CEO.
