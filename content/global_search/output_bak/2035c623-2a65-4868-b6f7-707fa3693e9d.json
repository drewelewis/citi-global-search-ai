In using Citi's SCF program, for example, the bank would provide financing to a client's suppliers from the date of collection of specific goods/provision of services to the date on which payment is owed to these suppliers. The cost of this financing is borne by suppliers at a rate lower than their usual cost of funds. As a result, suppliers benefit from cash flow acceleration, quicker payment, and improved financing costs.", "tag-4": "Citi's first MENA SSCF program has been implemented for German chemical and consumer goods company, Henkel. The program has been initially launched with suppliers in Algeria and will be expanded to include additional markets and suppliers in the coming months.", "tag-5": "The program is also a first for Henkel in IMEAT and is targeted at existing or new suppliers who demonstrate strong or improving sustainability performance. Qualifying suppliers can access Citi's supply chain financing at preferential rates, improving as a supplier's sustainability score improves. Henkel, with the support of a global leading sustainability assessment agency, will periodically assess the sustainability performance of its suppliers.", "tag-6": "Commenting on the collaboration, B\u00fclent Pehlivan, Regional Head of Finance, India, Middle East and Africa, said: \"With sustainability being at the core of our company's strategy, we are engaging in a range of activities with new ways of growing and innovative solutions to create value.

To help accelerate the transition to a global low-carbon economy, Citi launched its updated Sustainable Progress Strategy in July of last year, which includes its global US$500 Billion Environmental Finance Goal. Citi also recently established a commitment to US$1 trillion in sustainable finance by 2030, which includes the environmental finance goal and a US$500 Billion Social Finance Goal.", "tag-8": "\"We are proud to be collaborating with Henkel in this first SSCF program in the MENA region.
