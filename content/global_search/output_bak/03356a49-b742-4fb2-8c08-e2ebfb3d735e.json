First launched in 2015, this initiative supports visionary organizations that are working to connect low-income communities to greater social and economic opportunity. Through trust-based, unrestricted funding, technical assistance and a cohort-model learning community, Community Progress Makers works to catalyze and expand impact in communities across the U.S. The Foundation\u2019s longtime partner, Urban Institute, facilitated an afternoon of virtual panels, brainstorming and feedback sessions where the third cohort\u2019s participants reflected on the transformation and growth they have achieved over the two-year grant period.", "tag-3": "We heard about the unparalleled value that flexible funding had on each organization\u2019s ability to respond to challenges and to iterate solutions to ever-changing organizational and community needs. We learned that it pushed organizations to set and achieve new standards and become even more visionary in their goals. Participants also talked about the importance of facilitating community building among change agents so that their efforts do not take place in a vacuum. From knowledge sharing to networking and even the formation of new programmatic partnerships, we know that greater impact can be achieved when leaders work together. That is why, with the input and feedback from past participants, we will be establishing a Community Progress Makers alumni network to ensure that this incredible community continues to connect and thrive.", "tag-4": "We are proud of all that this cohort has achieved and are excited for their continued impact to come. As they join the alumni network of community change agents, we also look forward to announcing our next cohort of Community Progress Makers \u2013 more to come in 2024! In the meantime, let\u2019s take a look back at the third cohort\u2019s reflections, in their own words:", "tag-5": "In Their Words: Reflections from Six Community Progress Makers"}
