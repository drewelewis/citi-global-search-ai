In the late 60s, when the establishment of large private hospitals was not common, the institution was conceptualized & endowed to the city of Mumbai by Seth Lokoomal Chanrai. Seth Chanrai came from a family of philanthropists who had businesses in many countries. The family had already supported many small & large projects. Seth Lokoomal entrusted Dr. Shantilal Mehta the task of establishing an ultra-modern centrally located medical center where people of all races and creeds could receive the benefits of advanced health care. Jaslok Hospital is situated at Dr. G Deshmukh Marg, Peddar Road which is a main artery of South Mumbai and overlooks the Arabian Sea. The name Jaslok was derived from the names of Seth Lokoomal & his wife Smt. Jasotibai. Seth Chanrai's vision was implemented and brought to reality largely by his Brother-in-law Dada Mathradas Assomull. The hospital was inaugurated on 6th July 1973 by the erstwhile Prime Minister Mrs. Indira Gandhi.", "tag-17": "For additional Information please click: https://www.jaslokhospital.net/", "tag-18": "About Citi India:Committed to India for 120 years, Citi takes pride in being a premier locally embedded financial institution, backed by an unmatched global network.
