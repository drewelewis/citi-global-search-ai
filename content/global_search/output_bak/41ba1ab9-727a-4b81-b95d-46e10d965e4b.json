With almost every aspect of their lives up in the air -- securing a job, finding housing, and establishing financial plans -- many individuals and families struggle to prepare for the future.", "tag-1": "Mission Transition: Citi and Military.com Team Up on New Mobile App for Servicemembers and Families", "tag-2": "At Citi, we're working to respond to the complex challenges faced by military families, and to the unique needs of America's uniformed men and women who are transitioning out of the military in large numbers.

Some transition out after one enlistment, some retire after 20 years of service, while still others are National Guard Members or Reservists leaving a full time position to reenter the civilian workforce. These differences in experience can make it difficult for transitioning service members to locate the knowledge, tools and resources they need to become financially successful in the civilian world. I am familiar with this challenge firsthand.", "tag-4": "In 1996, after six years with the Air National Guard, I decided to build a professional civilian career while maintaining my membership in the military. In seeking to accomplish this goal I faced many challenges, including the difficulty of translating my military-speak into civilian terms, and finding a veteran-friendly employer that would support my desire to stay in the military while embarking on a civilian career. Fortunately, Citi took a chance on me \u2013 thanks to the generous support of my local community connections, who helped me kick-start my job search and translate my skill set into something potential employers would find appealing.", "tag-5": "Today, Citi launched the Transition App with Military.com to help transitioning military members to achieve long-term economic, social and professional security for themselves and their families. Designed for all members of the armed forces (Army, Marines, Navy, Air Force, Coast Guard) and members of the National Guard and Reserve components, the Transition app features hundreds of resources and articles filled with actionable advice on employment, finances, relocation, transition requirements, health benefits, education, and veteran benefits. The app is responsive to the diverse and wide-ranging needs of veterans while tailoring individual experiences to the unique transition path of each user.", "tag-6": "Available for iOS and Android, this free resource allows users to create personalized transition plans with an interactive checklist and notifications to alert users of important actions they need to take before their separation date. It includes veteran-specific job resources and allows users to search jobs and upcoming job fairs, while providing practical ways to translate their military knowledge and skills to corresponding civilian occupations.", "tag-7": "Citi's support for the Transition App complements the work of Citi Salutes, a company-wide initiative led by Citi Community Development with the engagement of employees across the firm, which supports service members and their families with career development opportunities, employee engagement efforts, banking services and partnerships with leading veterans' organizations.", "tag-8": "Through our support for the Transition App, our goal is to make the transition process less overwhelming while enabling thousands of service members to pursue stable careers and livelihoods. As a former service member myself, I'm deeply thankful to be able to continue to provide opportunities for our military men and women who have so bravely served our nation.", "tag-9": "The app is now available as a free download on iTunes App Store and Google Play.", "tag-10": "To learn more, read the press release."}
