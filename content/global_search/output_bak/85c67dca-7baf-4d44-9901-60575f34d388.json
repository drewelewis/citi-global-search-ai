Moreover, according to research by NDI, many individuals with disabilities have difficulty managing household finances and navigating the complexities of benefits, insurance, medical costs, and long-term supports while still preparing for retirement. Approximately one in four U.S. households with a person with a disability pay more than 50 percent of their income on housing.", "tag-5": "\"The intersections between housing, employment, and financial empowerment for people with disabilities is a critical component to making sure that policies best serve their needs,\" said Commissioner Victor Calise of the New York City Mayor's Office for People with Disabilities. \"This new initiative will lead to research and best practices that will greatly improve our understanding of how to deliver quality and accessible services to the disability community.
