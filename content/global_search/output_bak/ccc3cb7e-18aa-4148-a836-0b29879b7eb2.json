This marks a new facet of Citi's branding, an aural interpretation of the Citi brand that will be used company-wide to identify who we are via sound. Today, brands are built through immersive, intuitive experiences that engage emotions and all of the senses. Branded sound and music are powerful tools for creating emotional connections to what we do. With the support of colleagues from across the firm, we have developed a new Citi sonic identity, including a proprietary anthem, logo and tracks that will enhance our brand experience. You will notice Citi's sonic branding over the coming months as we continue to integrate it into many of our client touchpoints.", "tag-4": "Citi's firm-wide commitment to diversity and inclusion is also embedded in our new commercial. Citi is proud to partner with the Association of National Advertisers on the #SeeHer initiative, to eliminate unconscious bias in advertising and media, through the accurate portrayal of girls and women. Living up to our #SeeHer commitment, you'll notice the prominence of female characters in the story's most important roles, and a female narrator telling Citi's brand story. Less visible is the fact that our sonic identity was composed by a female-led orchestra. Citi's commitment is more than an ad, and I'm most proud of our teams around the world who consistently apply these values as we work to enable growth and economic progress in the communities we serve."}
