But harvests still lag far behind the rest of the world. The nonprofit One Acre Fund supplies smallholder farmers with everything they need to grow more food and earn more money, with the primary goal of enhancing food security. In partnership with the U.S. International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), Citi structured a $10 million flexible working capital solution for One Acre Fund in Kenya and an additional $5 million working capital facility for the other seven African countries where One Acre Fund operates. Since 2015, farmers who participate in One Acre Fund\u2019s programs earn on average nearly 50% more than peer farmers who are not on One Acre Fund-supported activities."}
