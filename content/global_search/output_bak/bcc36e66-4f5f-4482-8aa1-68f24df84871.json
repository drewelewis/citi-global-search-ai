This compared to net income of $3.6 billion, or $1.14 per diluted share, on revenues of $17.0 billion for the fourth quarter 2016.", "tag-5": "The net loss of $18.3 billion, or $7.15 per share, included an estimated one-time, non-cash charge of $22 billion, or $8.43 per share, recorded in the tax line within Corporate / Other, related to the enactment of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Reform)7. This charge is comprised of $19 billion related to the re-measurement of Citi's deferred tax assets (DTA) arising from a lower U.S. corporate tax rate and shift to a territorial tax regime, and $3 billion related to the deemed repatriation of unremitted earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, net income of $3.7 billion increased 4% from the prior year period. Earnings per share increased 12% to $1.28, driven by the higher net income and a 7% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding. These results include a combined net benefit of roughly $0.08 per share, recorded in Corporate / Other, related to discrete items that resulted in a lower-than-expected tax rate, as well as a one-time loss in discontinued operations.", "tag-6": "For the full year 2017, Citigroup reported a net loss of $6.2 billion on revenues of $71.4 billion, compared to net income of $14.9 billion on revenues of $69.9 billion for the full year 2016. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, Citigroup net income of $15.8 billion increased 6% compared to the prior year.", "tag-7": "Throughout the remainder of this press release, Citigroup and Corporate / Other's net income and Citigroup's effective tax rate are presented on a reported and adjusted basis, excluding the impact of Tax Reform.

Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, Citigroup's net income increased to $3.7 billion, as the higher revenues and the lower tax rate more than offset the higher cost of credit and the one-time loss in discontinued operations. Including the impact of Tax Reform, Citigroup's effective tax rate in the fourth quarter 2017 was not meaningful. Excluding the impact of Tax Reform, Citigroup's effective tax rate in the fourth quarter 2017 was 24.9% compared to 29.6% in the fourth quarter 2016.", "tag-13": "Citigroup's allowance for loan losses was $12.4 billion at quarter end, or 1.87% of total loans, compared to $12.1 billion, or 1.94% of total loans, at the end of the prior year period.

Excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation9, Citigroup's end of period loans grew 5%, as 7% aggregate growth in ICG and GCB was partially offset by the continued wind down of legacy assets in Corporate / Other.", "tag-15": "Citigroup's end of period deposits were $960 billion as of quarter end, up 3%. In constant dollars, Citigroup deposits were up 1%, as a 2% increase in ICG was slightly offset by a decline in Corporate / Other, and GCB remained largely unchanged.", "tag-16": "Citigroup's book value per share was $70.85 and tangible book value per share was $60.40, each at quarter end, representing 5% and 6% decreases, respectively, primarily reflecting the estimated impact of Tax Reform. At quarter end, Citigroup's Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) Capital ratio was 12.3%, down from 13.0% sequentially, driven primarily by the return of capital to common shareholders and the impact of Tax Reform (a reduction of approximately $6 billion of CET1 Capital or 40 bps to the CET1 Capital ratio). Citigroup's Supplementary Leverage Ratio for the fourth quarter 2017 was 6.7%, down from 7.1% sequentially, driven by a decrease in Tier 1 Capital as well as an increase in Total Leverage Exposure.

Retail banking revenues of $1.3 billion increased 7%. Excluding mortgage, retail banking revenues increased 14%, driven by continued growth in checking deposits and deposit margin, growth in investments and loans and increased commercial banking activity. Citi retail services revenues of $1.6 billion increased 2%, primarily reflecting continued loan growth. Citi-branded cards revenues of $2.2 billion increased 1%, as growth in interest-earning balances slightly outpaced the continued run-off of non-core portfolios as well as the higher cost to fund growth in transactor and promotional balances, given higher interest rates.", "tag-20": "North America GCB net income was $842 million, up 4%, as the higher revenues and a lower tax rate were partially offset by higher cost of credit. Operating expenses remained largely unchanged at $2.5 billion, as higher volume-related expenses and investments were offset by efficiency savings.", "tag-21": "North America GCB cost of credit increased 10% to $1.3 billion.

Latin America GCB card revenues increased 4% driven by growth in purchase sales and full rate revolving loans. Revenues in Asia GCB of $1.9 billion increased 8%. Within Asia GCB, retail banking increased 5%, driven by improvement in wealth management, partially offset by lower retail lending revenues. Asia GCB card revenues increased 11% reflecting growth in average loans and purchase sales, as well as a modest gain on the sale of a merchant acquiring business.", "tag-23": "International GCB net income increased 19% to $493 million. In constant dollars, net income increased 16%, as the higher revenues were partially offset by higher expenses and higher cost of credit.

Fixed Income Markets revenues of $2.4 billion in the fourth quarter 2017 decreased 18%, reflecting continued low volatility, as well as the comparison to a more robust trading environment in the prior year period as a result of the U.S. elections. Equity Markets revenues of $530 million decreased 23%, primarily driven by an episodic loss in derivatives of approximately $130 million, related to a single client event. Securities Services revenues of $603 million increased 14%, driven by growth in client volumes along with higher interest revenue.", "tag-27": "ICG net income of $2.2 billion decreased 7%, driven by higher cost of credit, the lower revenues and higher expenses.
