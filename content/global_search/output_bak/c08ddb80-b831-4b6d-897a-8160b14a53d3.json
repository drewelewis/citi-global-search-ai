We are excited to see the ideas and approaches that come from this year's City Accelerator.\"", "tag-5": "To date, City Accelerator has worked with 12 municipalities in the U.S. to test new ways to drive sustainable growth while increasing opportunity for lower-income residents. For example, the city of Philadelphia tested the use of various messages and attention-grabbing mailings to ensure that low-income seniors were signing up for subsidies offering a 25 percent reduction in their water bills. As a result of financial and technical assistance provided by City Accelerator, participation in the program doubled, and hundreds of Philadelphia's most vulnerable seniors are now receiving a discount that will make managing their household bills easier. Philadelphia's success with City Accelerator led to the launch of GovLabPHL, a multi-agency team headed by the Mayor's Policy Office focused on developing innovative and evidence-based practice in city government.", "tag-6": "The city of San Francisco is using its City Accelerator support to develop a financing plan to reinforce the city's coastal seawall, which protects vital public transportation assets and land designated for affordable housing on a parcel adjacent to the Port of San Francisco.", "tag-7": "\"By opening up the procurement process to small and diverse businesses owned by people of color, cities have an incredible opportunity to realize the publics' vision of a thriving, vital economy,\" said Ben Hecht, President and CEO of Living Cities. \"These five cities were asked to lead the way, and we are excited to lift up their work as examples of how we can create a new urban practice dedicated to getting dramatically better results for low income people faster.\"", "tag-8": "\"The City of Charlotte is committed to providing equal access and opportunities for all businesses to grow, especially businesses owned by people of color,\" said Charlotte Mayor Jennifer Roberts. \"Through the City's Charlotte Business INClusion Policy, we have made significant strides, achieving $41 million in spending with local Minority, Women, Small Business Enterprises in Fiscal Year 2016.
