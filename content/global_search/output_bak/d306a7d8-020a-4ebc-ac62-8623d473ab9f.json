That was a truly special milestone that demonstrates our longstanding commitment to a country that has meant so much to us over so many years. To commemorate our centennial, Citi gave a lasting gift to S\u00e3o Paulo \u2013 a sculpture by renowned artist Tomie Ohtake. The sculpture was placed on Paulista Avenue, where Citi Brazil has its headquarters and where we hold events for clients and colleagues. That same year, we were also recognized as a 'Great Place to Work' and 'Best Bank to Work [for] in Brazil,' and as the 'Best Company for Disabled Workers' in the country. All of these honors reflect our commitment to enable progress and growth for our clients, our colleagues, and our communities, and other stakeholders as well.", "tag-5": "I'm also proud that Citi has been such a strong supporter of S\u00e3o Paulo's growth and development over the course of many decades. For a recent example, last year we extended more than R$210 million in loans and investments for affordable housing. The Citi Foundation also supported a number of charitable organizations with over R$958,000 of funds, and more than 900 Citi colleagues contributed more than 3,800 volunteer hours.", "tag-6": "What are some of the key opportunities facing clients and customers in your market?", "tag-7": "Citi has contributed to Brazil's robust growth by channeling investment into the country's infrastructure and private industries, and also serving as the financial advisor to major companies.", "tag-8": "I think we present an opportunity for our clients to connect them with the rest of the world.", "tag-9": "We're the #1 in Custody for foreign investors and the Brazilian market leader in exchange operations for clients for the past eight years; we're also the largest bank in the country in International Cash transactions.
