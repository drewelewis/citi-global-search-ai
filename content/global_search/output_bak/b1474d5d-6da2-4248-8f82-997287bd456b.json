Through the fund, Youth Radio is preparing young people for the Bay Area's dynamic workforce by providing them with intensive training in media and technology, paid internships with industry professionals, college credits, industry certification and job placement services with industry partners.", "tag-5": "In key cities around the world, the Citi Foundation works with community and municipal leaders to support programs aimed at helping to reduce youth unemployment and improve the quality of the youth workforce. We're equally committed to supporting research that helps advance the field and contributes to the development of new economic opportunities for youth, which is why we recently released the Global Youth Survey 2017: Economic Prospects & Expectations, a survey conducted by the global market and opinion research firm Ipsos, to understand the economic expectations and aspirations of young people around the globe. According to the Ipsos survey, 75% of young people in the Bay Area believe that internships are critical for career success. By providing youth in the Bay Area with work-based learning opportunities that they see as critical to their success, Youth Radio and the Citi Foundation are creating Pathways to Progress for young people around the globe.
