This sentiment is supported by several key markets moving towards a T+1 settlement cycle recently, including the United States, Canada and India.", "tag-4": "Okan Pekin, Global Head of Securities Services at Citi, said: \"We are seeing a greater sense of momentum and purpose in all developments across the industry, in particular the determination to move to a T+1 settlement cycle.
