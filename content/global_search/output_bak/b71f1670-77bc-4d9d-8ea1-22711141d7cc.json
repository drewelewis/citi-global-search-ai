Supported by Citi Community Development, NASI has, for example, organized networking mixers for homeless veterans in Jacksonville, Florida, and bike builds in New York. The NASI network encompasses eight U.S. Citi locations and has impacted more than 13,000 veterans to date in 2016. By building relationships and working with local non-profits and VSOs, NASI volunteers have made a difference in their local communities for the past six years.", "tag-4": "The continued enthusiasm and dedication of Citi employees to NASI and its programs is inspiring to see. Last year NASI held 92 events across the country, covering a wide range of projects, including veteran homelessness, veteran employment, and military children. The commitment from the broader community is equally inspiring. Many of our events are filled by Citi volunteers in just a matter of hours.", "tag-5": "In partnership with local veterans' organizations, some of the events that NASI volunteers have supported include: donating more than 150 backpacks stuffed with school supplies in Jacksonville; hosting two cookouts for Operation Military Kids where they grilled more than 250 hotdogs and hamburgers in Columbus, Ohio; supporting the Armed Services YMCA Father Daughter Ball in Norfolk, Virginia; raising money for gift cards to be used by families with deployed service personnel from the Niagara Air Reserve for the holidays in Getzville, New York; and making more than 300 care packages to be distributed during the \"bring your children to work day\" in both Getzville and New York City.", "tag-6": "In addition to supporting local military and veteran families, Citi volunteers support veterans directly by providing career counseling, resume and interview assistance. Through partnerships with American Corporate Partners, Four Block, and the NYU Rusk Institute, our colleagues have played a meaningful role in helping countless veterans navigate the transition from the armed forces to the civilian workforce through mentoring and networking opportunities.", "tag-7": "The work that Citi volunteers accomplish through our engagement with NASI exemplifies our long-standing commitment to supporting our military veterans. This partnership has truly made a difference for those who have served our nation and the family members who support them."}
