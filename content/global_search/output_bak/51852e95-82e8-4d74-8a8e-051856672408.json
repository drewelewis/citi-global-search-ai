As technology is exerting a democratizing effect on finance, more of our customers are looking to us for investment guidance and tools on mobile. Through a co-creation process with our customers, we've built new features that provide clients with access to their broader financial picture, all in one place \u2013 virtually whenever and wherever they want it.", "tag-4": "These new mobile investment features include a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP), fund screener, consolidated search functionality and enhanced visualization. Through the Citi Mobile\u00ae App for iPhone\u00ae, any Citi client with a brokerage account now enjoys one-touch access to their financial advisors and the ability to manage their investments personally, without switching to another channel. These features give clients greater control and flexibility to manage and invest their money in their own way. Citi is one of the first major financial institutions in the US to introduce these capabilities on mobile devices.", "tag-5": "Dividend Reinvestment Plan: Now clients can enroll eligible securities in a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP) right within the app. Once a customer has opted in, this feature helps our clients put their cash dividends to work, instead of idling in their accounts.", "tag-6": "Fund Screener: The fund screener helps our clients make informed decisions about their trades and enables them to search for mutual funds approved on Citi's platform, and ETFs by asset class, performance and expense criteria.", "tag-7": "Investment Search: This consolidated search function makes investing easier for clients interested in managing their portfolios themselves. It provides consolidated search functionality within the investments section of the app. Upon entering a keyword, such as a stock symbol or company name, all the client's activities, holdings, trade confirmations, order status for the account(s) are displayed on a single screen. It nicely complements the trading and holding views.", "tag-8": "Performance Visualization: An enhanced visualization enables clients to track their portfolio's performance and make adjustments right within the app.", "tag-9": "Since unveiling new functionality for the Citi Mobile App for iPhone last year, our continual launch-and-learn strategy has driven how we optimize and introduce new experiences. This methodology has helped us extend new capabilities to customers in one fifth of the time and effort of traditional approaches. That behind-the-scenes transformation has already yielded a powerful positive response from our clients, driving accelerated adoption rates and deeper engagement across our customer base. We're excited to continue on this customer-driven journey and to share more updates from the road ahead.", "tag-10": "Note: Consolidated search functionality is available for Citigold and Citi Priority customers who have at least one brokerage account with Citi. The fund screener and DRIP are not available for retirement accounts."}
