Given our emphasis on Services, I am particularly pleased with our performance in Treasury and Trade Solutions. Fee growth, trade loans and cross-border transactions \u2014 buoyed by higher rates \u2014 led to year over year revenue growth of 18%. Securities Services also performed well, with revenue up 6%. In Markets, our traders navigated the environment quite well, aided by our mix, with strong gains in FX and commodities. However, the current macro backdrop impacted Investment Banking as we saw a contraction in capital market activity. This remains a key area of investment for us.\"", "tag-9": "\"We continue to see the health and resilience of the U.S. consumer through our cost of credit and their payment rates. We had good engagement in key drivers such as cards loan growth and vigorous purchase sales growth, so we like where this business is headed.
