Client's corporate treasury functions are also being challenged with these changes, and together with the rapid growth of instant payments, their expectations for speed in processing payments continue to rise.", "tag-6": "Citi's strategy is to create integrated, smart and efficient solutions powering the Treasury of the Future. Citi\u00ae' Payment Outlier Detection's machine learning technology automatically adjusts controls to monitor discrepancies and changes in client payment behavior, allowing for the analysis and identification of potential anomalies in affected payments before they are sent for clearing. It does this while helping to ensure that payments are processed quickly and efficiently.", "tag-7": "\"Citi is committed to providing clients with solutions that deliver enhanced control, transparency and efficiency for their global payments\", said Manish Kohli, Global Head of Payments and Receivables, with Citi's Treasury and Trade Solutions. \"Citi\u00ae Payment Outlier Detection is yet another example of our execution against this goal and providing clients with tools that leverage innovation and new technologies for unique value,\" he added.", "tag-8": "This launch follows an extensive global pilot with 20 clients and is built on design principles that require minimum integration effort for clients. A key differentiator for Citi\u00ae Payment Outlier Detection is its usage of advanced statistical machine learning algorithms instead of legacy rules-based logic to analyze payment patterns. This enables the system to automatically adjust in response to changing payment patterns as businesses evolve, expand and globalize. The enhanced solution also has client configurable product features such as the ability to synchronize payment release with the cut-off times, enhanced analytics and an increased choice of entitlement options.", "tag-9": "\"Achieving real time visibility and fraud control over our payment processing is a major goal for Xerox.

Citi Payment Outlier Detection helps identify potential fraud attempts as well as operational errors in payment instructions, and I believe this type of control will play an integral role in having a more secure and efficient payments process for all companies in the future,\" said David Thilthorpe, Treasurer, Tetra Laval International, another early pilot client.", "tag-11": "Citi\u00ae Payment Outlier Detection was developed in the Citi Innovation Lab in Dublin, Ireland with direct client collaboration.
