But we are all on different paths to get there.", "tag-3": "For many Americans, there are barriers and inequities when striving to reach financial goals. Access. Lack of familiarity with products. Concerns about fees. Those are a few of the factors influencing why unbanked and underbanked communities do not use or have access to financial institutions.", "tag-4": "To expand banking access and accelerate wealth creation, Citi is focused on developing and implementing service and product enhancements to support financial progress for all. Our Financial Inclusion and Racial Equity (FI&RE) research has helped us better understand how to best meet the unique financial needs of unbanked and underbanked communities. From seeking resources that can help build and manage credit to transparency about banking fees and rules, we identified key barriers and pain points experienced by communities that traditionally don\u2019t get heard. We listened to their goals, which ranged from immediate to longer-term priorities, to shape how we deliver solutions with an\u00a0inclusion-centered approach.", "tag-5": "Bringing together some of Citi\u2019s inclusive products, services, and tools into a new destination on Citi.com, we are proud to introduce\u00a0Citi Financial Pathways.
