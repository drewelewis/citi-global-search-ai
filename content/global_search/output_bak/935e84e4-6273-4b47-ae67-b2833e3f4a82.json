You don't get to be this size and last this long without an innate ability to react smartly and nimbly to systemic threats. Under [the region's] chief executive Peter Babej, Citi Asia Pacific was quick to react to the coronavirus crisis.", "tag-4": "For retail and small business customers across the region, Citi provided a range of assistance, including fee waivers on loan extensions and reduced financing rates. For Asian institutional clients, the firm delivered effective and innovative capital solutions across its global platform, raising over US$10 billion. These transactions included the bank's first virtual IPO, for Nasdaq listed Huize, in which all roadshows were held via video and audio. Citi provided equally innovative support to its trade finance and cash management clients, using its digital infrastructure to support remote onboarding, payments and collections.", "tag-5": "Euromoney's editorial added, \"Within weeks, 75% of its workforce had transitioned to working from home, and it disbursed special compensation awards to 25,000 staff. When India went into lockdown, digital support staff worked overtime to ensure that corporate clients from Asia to the Americas were able to pay staff on time. Zoom meetings became de rigeur; virtual events and resources were put in place to ensure employees and their families were cared for.\"", "tag-6": "To date Citi has provided over $10 million in relief measures for communities across Asia Pacific, including working with the United Nations Development Programme to raise funds in several markets.
