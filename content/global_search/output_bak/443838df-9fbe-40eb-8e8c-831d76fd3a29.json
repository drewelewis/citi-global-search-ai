Congress had declared hostilities in 1812 following tensions with Britain over America's trade with France. In the summer of 1814, British troops captured Washington D.C., the nation's new capital. They set fire to several public buildings, including the White House and the Capitol. The backdrop to these dramatic events was the French Emperor Napoleon's vision of his country's global dominance, which was defeated - at least temporarily - at the hands of Britain and its coalition partners Austria, Prussia, and Russia in the spring of 1814. Napoleon's forced abdication and brief exile to the Mediterranean island of Elba strengthened the position of Britain, which was able to divert increased resources to the conflict across the Atlantic (Napoleon escaped from Elba, to be finally defeated at the Battle of Waterloo in 1815).", "tag-4": "During the war, the United States' currency and treasury bills were losing value, trade was languishing and businesses failing. In mid-July, City Bank of New York appointed a committee of directors to \"make proper arrangements for the removal of the books, cash etc., belonging to the bank, in case of the invasion of the city by the enemy.\" A separate committee comprising William Irving, John Swartwout, and Samuel Tooker was later set up to cooperate with other banks and \"prevent the export of specie to the enemy.\"", "tag-5": "Following the British invasion of Washington, New York City's banks suspended gold and silver payments on August 31, a day after banks in Philadelphia did the same. As hostilities began winding down towards the end of 1814, City Bank lent the federal government $200,000 to help it meet interest and amortization payments on its debt. The bank had already lent $500,000 to the underwriter of a government bond issue earlier in the year and had also subscribed to war bonds in 1813. In exchange, it was designated as a government depository, receiving a third of all federal balances held in New York."}
