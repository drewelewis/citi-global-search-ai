He is the Global Senior Business Sponsor for both the London & New York LGBT employee networks, serves as the Citi Pride business sponsor representative, and works closely with Citi's Senior Management, as well as with our colleagues in the businesses, legal, government affairs & Diversity offices to promote LGBT inclusion and rights globally.", "tag-5": "Recognized yet again as one of OUTstanding/FT's 2016 Leading 30 Ally Executives, Jim Cowles leads by example in his support for the LGBT community and is one of Citi's most visible senior allies.

He has championed senior manager diversity training, and actively supports the creation and adoption of more inclusive policies across Citi.", "tag-6": "This announcement by OUTstanding/FT underscores the many ways in which Citi has taken a stand for progress on behalf of its LGBT employees, clients and stakeholders.

Windsor, and joined the Human Rights Campaign and more than 100 other companies in public opposition to anti-Trans legislation in North Carolina and elsewhere in the U.S. Citi sponsors and participates in annual Pride Parades in London, New York City and elsewhere, and continues to work with the Human Rights Campaign and other organizations such as Out on the Street, Out & Equal and most recently with SAGE USA's Elder Housing Initiative.", "tag-7": "We have strived to ensure that Citi provides a diverse and inclusive workplace and that, along with leading LGBT organizations and other global corporations, we explore other opportunities to support progressive change wherever possible in support of under-represented communities. We congratulate Bob and Jim for once again achieving this distinguished recognition on behalf of Citi for their leadership in advancing diversity and inclusion."}
