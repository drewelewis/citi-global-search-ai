Excluding these divestiture-related impacts, earnings per share was $1.865. This compares to divestiture-related impacts in the first quarter 2022 of $(677) million5 in earnings before taxes ($(588) million after-tax), primarily driven by a goodwill impairment related to Asia Consumer Banking, also recorded in Legacy Franchises.", "tag-8": "Revenues increased 12% from the prior-year period and 6% excluding the divestiture-related impacts5, as growth in net interest income was partially offset by lower non-interest revenues. The higher net interest income was driven by the impact of higher interest rates across businesses, including Services and Markets in Institutional Clients Group (ICG), as well as strong growth in average loans in US Personal Banking within Personal Banking and Wealth Management (PBWM). The lower non-interest revenues reflected declines in Investment Banking and Markets in ICG and lower investment product revenues in Global Wealth Management in PBWM.", "tag-9": "Net income of $4.6 billion increased 7% from the prior-year period, and decreased 19% excluding the divestiture-related impacts5.

This increase in expenses was also driven by the impact of inflation and severance costs. The increase in expenses was partially offset by the benefit of productivity savings and foreign exchange translation as well as expense reduction from the closed exit markets and wind-downs.", "tag-19": "Citigroup cost of credit was approximately $2.0 billion in the first quarter 2023, compared to $0.8 billion in the prior-year period, reflecting a net build in the allowance for credit losses (ACL) for loans and unfunded commitments of $241 million and other provisions of $432 million, primarily driven by macroeconomic deterioration and growth in card revolving balances in PBWM. This compared to a net ACL release for loans and unfunded commitments of $(138) million in the prior-year period. The higher cost of credit also reflected higher net credit losses, primarily driven by ongoing normalization in Branded Cards and Retail Services.", "tag-20": "Citigroup net income of $4.6 billion in the first quarter 2023 increased 7% from the prior-year period, primarily driven by the higher revenue, partially offset by the higher expenses and the higher cost of credit.

At quarter end, Citigroup\u2019s CET1 capital ratio was 13.4% versus 13.0% in the prior quarter, largely driven by the benefits of net income, closing of exit markets, and positive AOCI impact through Citigroup\u2019s investment portfolio. The increase in the CET1 capital ratio was partially offset by the payment of common dividends. Citigroup\u2019s Supplementary Leverage ratio for the first quarter 2023 was 5.9% versus 5.8% in the prior quarter.

Excluding gain/loss on loan hedges6, Banking revenues of $1.4 billion decreased 21%, driven by lower revenues in Investment Banking and Corporate Lending. Investment Banking revenues of $774 million decreased 25%, as continued geopolitical uncertainty, heightened macroeconomic uncertainty and volatility continued to impact client activity.
