This compared to net income of $4.0 billion, or $1.24 per diluted share, on revenues of $17.5 billion for the second quarter 2016.", "tag-5": "Revenues increased 2% from the prior year period, driven by growth in Institutional Clients Group (ICG) and Global Consumer Banking (GCB), partially offset by lower revenues in Corporate / Other. Net income of $3.9 billion decreased 3%, as the higher revenues were more than offset by higher cost of credit and operating expenses, as well as a higher effective tax rate. Earnings per share of $1.28 increased 3% from $1.24 per diluted share in the prior year period, driven by a 6% reduction in average diluted shares outstanding, partially offset by the lower net income.", "tag-6": "In the discussion throughout the remainder of this press release, percentage comparisons are calculated for the second quarter 2017 versus the second quarter 2016, unless otherwise specified.", "tag-7": "Read the full press release with tables and CEO commentary.", "tag-8": "Citigroup", "tag-9": "Citigroup's net income decreased to $3.9 billion in the second quarter 2017, as the higher revenues were more than offset by higher cost of credit and operating expenses, as well as a higher effective tax rate.

Citi retail services revenues of $1.6 billion increased 4%, reflecting continued loan growth and a favorable prior period comparison.

Fixed Income Markets revenues of $3.2 billion in the second quarter 2017 decreased 6% primarily reflecting lower G10 currencies revenue, given low volatility in the current quarter and the comparison to higher Brexit-related activity a year ago. Equity Markets revenues of $691 million decreased 11%, reflecting episodic activity in the prior year period, as well as low volatility in the current quarter. Securities Services revenues of $584 million increased 10% driven by growth in client volumes across the global custody business.", "tag-26": "ICG net income of $2.8 billion increased 6%, driven by the higher revenues, partially offset by higher operating expenses.
