Despite this, though, the 41-year-old Spanish legend feels he is far from done with motor racing. So, what keeps powering him onward?

(The true figure is likely higher owing to persistent under-recording.) Inspired partly by the bravery of Ryan White, a young boy who died of AIDS after a contaminated blood transfusion, Elton decided to commit himself to the struggle against this cruel blight on humanity.

Despite great natural beauty and rich culture, the region has over time endured poverty, periodic famines and outbreaks of warfare. But of all that she witnessed on her early visits to the country, there was one encounter especially that Mabel van Oranje will never forget.

But as their ship drew closer to the Antarctic shoreline, Martin and Carmel Naughton\u2019s wonderment became mixed with sadness. The telltale signs of melting coastal glaciers were plain to see. And the graphic scene they were witnessing was no mere seasonal effect. The ship\u2019s captain brought out a map to show them just how far the ice sheet had retreated in the previous decade alone. I think that experience had a profound effect on my parents, says Neil Naughton. I recall that when they returned from that trip, my father sat us down at work and told us the frightening developments that he\u2019d seen first-hand. He said that things were changing much faster than most people understood, and that our company had a responsibility to do whatever we could.

Covid-19 \u2013 recently declared a pandemic \u2013 was creating intense uncertainty the world over. Occupancy at her family\u2019s chain of hotels across Canada, of which she was the CEO, was in freefall. However, it wasn\u2019t the unprecedented business turmoil that was keeping her awake, as she explained in an early-morning phone call with her younger brother. All that Reetu could think about was how the pandemic was going to affect others, recalls Suraj Gupta. She kept saying how there were already so many people suffering in the world, even before the health crisis hit. With things deteriorating so fast, she said we had to think of ways to help. I wasn\u2019t at all surprised by her reaction; trying to assist others and make the world better is just her mentality.
