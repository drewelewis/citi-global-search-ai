But as their ship drew closer to the Antarctic shoreline, Martin and Carmel Naughton\u2019s wonderment became mixed with sadness. The telltale signs of melting coastal glaciers were plain to see.

I think that experience had a profound effect on my parents, says Neil Naughton. I recall that when they returned from that trip, my father sat us down at work and told us the frightening developments that he\u2019d seen first-hand.
