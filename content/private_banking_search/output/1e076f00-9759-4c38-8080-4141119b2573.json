Introduction The Payment Services Directive Regulations (\u201cPSD2\u201d) enshrined the right of the newly regulated account information service providers (\u201cAISPs\u201d), payment information service providers (\u201cPISPs\u201d) and card-based payment instrument issuers (\u201cCBPIIs\u201d) to access customer payment accounts held with account servicing payment service providers (\u201cASPSPs\u201d), based on the customers\u2019 explicit consent.\u00a0 As part of this the European Banking Authority (\u201cEBA\u201d) developed a regulatory technical standard (\u201cRTS\u201d) on strong customer authentication (\u201cSCA\u201d) and common and secure communication (\u201cCSC\u201d) that\u00a0 provides detail on the new security requirements under PSD2 and regulate the access of AISPs, PISPs and CBPIIs to the customer payment account data held with ASPSPs.\u00a0 Citi Private Bank Compliance with the regulation In compliance with the PSD2 regulation Citi Private Bank has developed a dedicated Application Programming Interface (\u201cAPI\u201d) that enables authorised Third Party Payment Providers (\u201cTPPs\u201d)\u00a0 to view and access its clients cash accounts in the UK and Luxembourg. Accessing the API TPPs can connect to Citi Private Bank\u2019s dedicated API to perform testing in a\u00a0sandbox environment. The API is available for \u201clive\u201d testing.\u00a0 For further information on our API please\u00a0send an email.\u00a0 Identification of TPPs In order to identify a TPP, we will rely on qualified certificates for electronic seals as referred to in Article 3(30) of the eIDAS Regulation 2014. If a TPP does not have an eIDAS certificate, please\u00a0contact us\u00a0to discuss potential alternatives. Effective 1 July 2021: Citi Private Bank will identify a TPP using a valid eIDAS (QWAC & QSEAL) certificates from QTSPs (Qualified Trust Service Providers) for TPPs registered within the EEA, or OBIE (OB WAC & OB Seal) certificates from OBIEs (Open Banking Implementation Entities) for TPPs registered within the UK."}
